therefore O
have O
we O

dubbed O
it O
" O
RANCOR O

. O

The O
Rancor B-Malware

attacks O
use O
two O
primary O
malware O
families O
which O
we O
describe O
in O

later O
in O
this O

and O
are O
naming O
DDKONG B-Malware

PLAINTEE B-Malware

We O

indicate O
these O
attacks O
began O
with O
spear O

messages O
but O
have O
not O
observed O
the O

. O

Based O
on O
this O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
Rancor B-Malware
attackers O
were O
targeting O
political O
entities O
. O

Additionally O
, O
these O
decoy O
documents O
are O
hosted O
on O
legitimate O
websites O
including O
a O

belonging O
to O
the O

in O
at O

Our O

the O
earliest O
known O
sample O
being O
observed O
in O
October O
2017 O
. O

The O
RANCOR B-Malware
campaign O
represents O
a O
continued O
trend O
of O
targeted O
attacks O
against O
entities O
within O
the O
South O
East O
Asia O
region O
. O

They O
are O
interested O
in O
users O
of O
remote O
banking O

( O
RBS O
) O
, O
mainly O
in O
Russia O
and O
neighboring O
countries O
. O

That O
this O
group O
is O
mostly O
targeting O
businesses O
is O
apparent O
from O
the O
processes O
they O
are O
looking O
for O
on O
a O

. O

While O
both O
RTM B-Malware

Buhtrap B-Malware
are O
looking O
for O
a O
quite O
similar O
process O
list O
, O
the O
infection O
vectors O
are O
quite O
different O
. O

This O
group O
has O
used O
a O
large O
array O
of O
infection O
vectors O
, O
mostly O
revolving O
around O
drive-by O
downloads O
and O
spam O
. O

They O
are O
both O
targeting O
businesses O
using O
accounting O

, O
are O
fingerprinting O

of O

similarly O
, O
are O

finally O
, O
they O
deploy O
an O

it O

The O
tools O
and O
techniques O
used O

are O
consistent O
with O
several O
Chinese O
threat O
actors O

from O
which O
the O
attackers O
gathered O
information O
about O
the O

and O
propagated O
across O
the O

The O
initial O
indicator O
of O
the O

, O
uncovered O
several O
attack O
phases O

A O
second O
method O
the O

, O
since O
they O
won’t O
execute O

they O
are O
32 O

We O
recently O
observed O
a O

of O
the O

detected O
roughly O
90 O
phony O
Apple-like B-System

In O
this O
blog O
we O
provide O
insight O
into O
the O
tactics O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
(TTPs) O
of O
a O
Brazilian O
cyber O
crime O
group O
that O
specializes O
in O
payment O
card O
fraud O
operations O
. O

The O
threat O
actors O
, O
observed O
by O
FireEye B-Organization
Labs I-Organization
, I-Organization
use O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise O
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
, O
including O
sharing O
or O
purchasing O
dumps O
online O
, O
hacking O
vulnerable O
merchant O
websites O
and O
compromising O
payment O
card O
processing O
devices O
. O

Once O
in O
their O
possession O
, O
the O
actors O
use O
these O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
to O
generate O
further O
card O
information O
. O

The O
members O
of O
the O
group O
use O
a O
variety O
of O
tools O
, O
including O
CCleaner O
, O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
to O
effectively O
remove O
any O
evidence O
of O
their O
operations O
. O

Another O
common O
step O
taken O
by O
threat O
actors O
is O
changing O
their O
system's O
MAC O
Address O
to O
avoid O
being O
uniquely O
identified O
. O

For O
this O
purpose O
, O
these O
actors O
often O
use O
tools O
such O
as O
Technitium O
MAC O
Address O
Changer O
. O

We O
have O
observed O
these O
actors O
using O
Tor B-System
or O
proxy-based O
tools O
similar O
to O
Tor B-System
(e.g O
, O
UltraSurf B-System
, I-System
as O
seen O
in O
Figure O
2) O
. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
them O
using O
virtual O
private O
network O
services O
that O
use O
IPs O
based O
in O
numerous O
countries O
to O
ensure O
anonymity O
and O
obfuscate O
criminal O
operations O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
observations O
, O
this O
group O
uses O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise O
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
. O

Payment O
card O
dumps O
are O
commonly O
shared O
amongst O
Brazilian O
threat O
actors O
via O
social O
media O
forums O
such O
as O
Facebook B-System
, I-System
Skype B-System
, I-System
and O
web-based O
WhatsApp B-System
messenger O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
group O
takes O
advantage O
of O
freely O
available O
consolidations O
of O
email O
credentials O
, O
personal O
information O
, O
and O
other O
data O
shared O
in O
eCrime B-Malware
forums O
for O
fraud O
purposes O
. O

These O
actors O
scan O
websites O
for O
vulnerabilities O
to O
exploit O
to O
illicitly O
access O
databases O
. O

They O
most O
commonly O
target O
Brazilian O
merchants O
, O
though O
others O
use O
the O
same O
tactics O
to O
exploit O
entities O
outside O
Brazil O
. O

The O
group O
also O
uses O
the O
SQL O
injection O
(SQLi) O
tools O
Havij B-Vulnerability
Advanced I-Vulnerability
SQL I-Vulnerability
Injection I-Vulnerability
Tool I-Vulnerability
and O
SQLi B-Vulnerability
Dumper I-Vulnerability
version I-Vulnerability
7.0 I-Vulnerability
(Figure O
4) O
to O
scan O
for O
and O
exploit O
vulnerabilities O
in O
targeted O
eCommerce O
sites O
. O

At O
least O
eight O
sellers O
update O
the O
website O
as O
frequently O
as O
daily O
, O
offering O
newly O
obtained O
databases O
from O
the O
U.S O
. O

Once O
in O
possession O
of O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
, O
these O
actors O
use O
tools O
commonly O
known O
as O
card O
generators O
to O
generate O
new O
card O
numbers O
based O
on O
the O
compromised O
ones O
, O
creating O
additional O
opportunities O
for O
monetization O
. O

One O
bulk O
card-checking O
tool O
this O
group O
uses O
is O
Testador B-Malware
Amazon.com B-Indicator
v1.1 O
(Figure O
8). O
Despite O
its O
name O
, O
this O
tool O
does O
not O
use O
Amazon’s B-Organization
website O
, O
but O
exploits O
an O
unauthenticated B-Vulnerability
Cross-Site I-Vulnerability
Request I-Vulnerability
Forgery I-Vulnerability
(CSRF) I-Vulnerability
vulnerability O
of O
a O
merchant O
website O
allowing O
the O
abuse O
of O
PayPal B-System
Payflow I-System
link O
functionality O
(Figure O

. O

Based O
on O
our O
observations O
of O
interactions O
in O
this O
channel O
, O
between O
May O
2016 O
and O
June O
2016 O
, O
malicious O
actors O
validated O
2 O
, O
987 O
cards O
from O
62 O
countries O
, O
with O
the O
most O
coming O
from O
the O
U.S. O
(nearly O
half) O
, O
Brazil O
, O
and O
France O
. O

The O
actors O
frequently O
use O
the O
stolen O
data O
to O
create O
cloned O
physical O
cards O
, O
which O
they O
use O
to O
attempt O
to O
withdraw O
funds O
from O
ATMs O
. O

The O
group O
primarily O
uses O
the O
MSR B-System
606 I-System
Software O
(Figure O
12) O
and O
Hardware O
(Figure O
13) O
to O
create O
cloned O
cards O
. O

However O
, O
Brazilian O
actors O
commonly O
use O
several O
methods O
to O
do O
so O
, O
such O
as O
reselling O
cards O
they O
have O
created O
, O
paying O
bills O
with O
stolen O
cards O
in O
return O
for O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
bill's O
value O
and O
reselling O
illicitly O
obtained O
goods O
. O

Some O
attacker O
tools O
were O
used O
to O
almost O
exclusively O
target O
organizations O
within O
APAC O
. O

In O
April O
2015 O
, O
we O
uncovered O
the O
malicious O
efforts O
of O
APT30 B-Organization
, I-Organization
a O
suspected O
China-based O
threat O
group O
that O
has O
exploited O
the O

and O
organizations O
across O
the O
region O
, O
targeting O
highly O
sensitive O
political O
, O
economic O

military O
information O
. O

The O
individuals O
using O
Hancitor B-Malware
malware O
also O
known O
by O
the O
name O
Chanitor B-Malware
are O
no O
exception O
and O
have O
taken O
three O
approaches O
to O
deliver O
the O
malware O
in O
order O
to O
ultimately O
steal O
data O
from O
their O
victims O
. O

We O
recently O
observed O
Hancitor B-Malware
attacks O
against O
some O
of O
our O
FireEye B-System

Guard I-System
customers O
. O

The O
group O
has O
performed O
these O
activities O
at O
multiple O
locations O
across O
Brazil O
, O
possibly O
using O
multiple O
mules O
. O

Once O
downloaded O
and O
executed O
, O
it O
drops O
an O
intermediate O
payload O
that O
further O
downloads O
a O
Pony B-Malware
DLL O
and O
Vawtrak B-Malware
executable O
, O
which O
perform O
data O
theft O
and O
connect O
to O
a O

In O
this O
blog O
, O
FireEye B-Organization
Labs I-Organization
dissects O
this O
new O
ATM O
malware O
that O
we O
have O
dubbed O
RIPPER B-Malware
(due O
to O
the O
project O
name O
ATMRIPPER” B-Malware
identified O
in O
the O
sample) O
and O
documents O
indicators O
that O
strongly O
suggest O
this O
piece O
of O
malware O
is O
the O
one O
used O
to O
steal O
from O
the O
ATMs O
at O
banks O
in O
Thailand O
. O

RIPPER B-Malware
interacts O
with O
the O
ATM O
by O
inserting O
a O
specially O
manufactured O
ATM O
card O
with O
an O
EMV O
chip O
that O
serves O
as O
the O
authentication O
mechanism O
. O

RIPPER B-Malware
will O
examine O
the O
contents O
of O
directories O
associated O
with O
the O
targeted O
ATM O
vendors O
and O
will O
replace O
legitimate O
executables O
with O
itself O
. O

Once O
a O
valid O
card O
with O
a O
malicious O
EMV O
chip O
is O
detected O
, O
RIPPER B-Malware
will O
instantiate O
a O
timer O
to O
allow O
a O
thief O
to O
control O
the O

Our O
analysis O
has O
led O
us O
to O
conclude O
that O
APT1 B-Malware
is O
likely O
government-sponsored O
and O
one O
of O
the O
most O
persistent O
of O
China O

The O
simplest O
conclusion O
based O
on O
these O
facts O
is O
that O
APT1 B-Malware
is O
operating O
in O
China O
, O
and O
most O
likely O
in O

that O
APT1 B-Malware

either O
operating O

or O
that O
APT1 B-Malware

going O
to O

The O
origins O
of O
the O
Duke B-Malware
toolset O
names O
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
when O
researchers O
at O
Kaspersky B-Organization
Labs I-Organization
coined O
the O
term O
" O
MiniDuke B-Malware
" O
to O
identify O
the O
first O
Duke-related B-Malware
malware O
they O
found O
. O

As O
researchers O
continued O
discovering O
new O
toolsets O
that O
were O
created O
and O
used O
by O
the O
same O
group O
that O
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke B-Malware
, I-Malware
and O
thus O
the O
threat O
actor O
operating O
the O
toolsets O
started O
to O
be O
commonly O
referred O
to O
as O
" O
Dukes O
" O

Based O
on O
the O
campaign O

in O

samples O
discovered O
from O

, O
the O

Importantly O
, O
PinchDuke B-Malware
trojan O
samples O
always O
contain O
a O
notable O
text O
string O
, O
which O
we O
believe O
is O
used O
as O
a O
campaign O
identifier O
by O
the O
Dukes B-Organization
group O
to O
distinguish O
between O
multiple O
attack O
campaigns O
that O
are O
run O
in O
parallel O
. O

This O
neatly O
ties O
together O
many O
of O
the O
tools O
used O
by O
the O
Dukes B-Malware
group O
, O
as O
versions O
of O
this O
one O

have O
been O
used O
to O
load O

from O
three O
different O
Dukes-related B-Malware
toolsets O

PinchDuke B-Malware
, I-Malware
and O
MiniDuke B-Malware
– O
over O
the O
course O
of O
five O
years O
. O

The O
Dukes O
continued O
the O
expansion O
of O
their O
arsenal O
in O
2011 O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
two O
more O
toolsets O
: O
MiniDuke B-Malware
and O
CozyDuke B-Malware
. I-Malware

As O
we O
now O
know O
, O
by O
February O
2013 O
the O
Dukes B-Organization
group O
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke B-Malware
and O
other O
toolsets O
for O
at O

4 O
and O
a O
half O
years O
. O

Secondly O
, O
the O
value O
the O
Dukes O
intended O
to O
gain O
from O
these O
MiniDuke B-Malware
campaigns O
may O
have O
been O
so O
great O
that O
they O
deemed O
it O
worth O
the O
risk O
of O
getting O
noticed O
. O

This O
is O
in O
stark O
contrast O
to O
some O
other O
suspected O
Russian O
threat O
actors O
( O
such O
as O
Operation B-Malware

) I-Malware
who O
appear O
to O
have O
increased O
their O

following O
the O
crisis O
. O

The O
Dukes O
actively O
targeted O
Ukraine O
before O
the O
crisis O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
Russia O
was O
still O
weighing O
her O
options O
, O
but O
once O
Russia O
moved O
from O
diplomacy O
to O
direct O
action O
, O
Ukraine O
was O
no O
longer O
relevant O
to O
the O
Dukes O
in O
the O

way O
. O

In O
the O
latter O
case O
however O
, O
the O
Dukes B-Organization
group O
appear O
to O
have O
also O
simultaneously O
developed O
an O
entirely O

we O
first O
observed O
being O
used O
in O

with O

the O

. O

The O

could O
have O

We O

only O

of O
one O
instance O
- O
the O
exploitation O
of O
CVE-2013-0640 B-Vulnerability
to O
deploy O

where O
we O

the O
exploited O
vulnerability O
was O
a O
zero-day O

the O

the O

All O
of O

in O

that O

APT38 B-Malware

believed O
to O
operate O
more O
similarly O
to O

carefully O
conducting O

with O

cyber O
espionage O
activity O
, O
although O
we O
consider O
APT38 B-Malware

We O
consider O
APT38 B-Malware
's I-Malware
operations O
more O
global O
and O
highly O
specialized O
for O
targeting O
the O
financial O
sector O
. O

APT38 B-Malware
is O
a O
financially O
motivated O
group O
linked O
to O
North O
Korean O
cyber O
espionage O
operators O
, O
renown O
for O
attempting O
to O
steal O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
dollars O
from O
financial O
institutions O
and O
their O
brazen O
use O
of O
destructive O
malware O
. O

Because O
APT38 B-Malware
is O
backed O
by O
( O
and O
acts O
on O

of O
) O
the O
North O
Korean O
regime O
, O
we O
opted O
to O
categorize O
the O
group O
as O
an O
" O
APT O
" O
instead O
of O
a O
" O
FIN O
" O
. O

Over O
time O
these O

similarities O
diverged O
, O
as O
did O
targeting O
, O
intended O
outcomes O
, O
and O
TTPs O
, O
almost O
certainly O
indicating O
that O
TEMP.Hermit B-Malware
activity O
is O
made O
up O
of O
multiple O
operational O
groups O
primarily O
linked O
together O
with O
shared O
malware O
development O
resources O
and O
North O
Korean O
state O
sponsorship O
. O

Based O
on O
observed O
activity O
, O
we O
judge O
that O
APT38 B-Malware
's I-Malware
primary O
mission O
is O
targeting O
financial O
institutions O
and O
manipulating O
inter-bank O
financial O
systems O
to O
raise O
large O
sums O
of O
money O
for O
the O
North O
Korean O
regime O
. O

Since O
2015 O
, O
APT38 B-Malware
has O
attempted O
to O
steal O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
dollars O
from O
financial O
institutions O
. O

APT38 B-Malware
has O
pursued O
their O
main O
objective O
of O
targeting O
banks O
and O
financial O
entities O
since O
at O
least O
2014 O
. O

We O
surmise O
that O
the O
targeting O
of O
banks O
, O
media O
, O
and O
government O
agencies O
is O
conducted O
in O
support O
of O
APT38 B-Malware
's I-Malware
primary O
mission O
. O

The O
APT38 B-Malware
targeted O
news O
outlets O
known O
for O
their O
business O
and O
financial O
sector O
reporting O
, O
probably O
in O
support O
of O
efforts O
to O
identify O
and O
compromise O
additional O
financial O
institutions O
. O

APT38 B-Malware
also O
targeted O
financial O
transaction O
exchange O
companies O
likely O
because O
of O
their O
proximity O
to O
banks O
. O

Given O
the O
lapse O
in O
time O
between O
the O
spear-phishing O
and O
the O
heist O
activity O
in O
the O
above O
example O
, O
we O
suggest O
two O
separate O
but O
related O
groups O
under O
the O
North O
Korean O
regime O
were O
responsible O
for O
carrying O
out O
missions O
; O
one O
associated O
with O

APT38 B-Malware
, I-Malware
in O
particular O
, O
is O
strongly O
distinguishable O
because O
of O
its O
specific O
focus O
on O
financial O
institutions O
and O
operations O
that O
attempt O
to O
use O
SWIFT B-System
fraud O
to O
steal O
millions O
of O
dollars O
at O
a O
time O
. O

We O
can O
confirm O
that O
the O
APT38 B-Malware
operator O
activity O
is O
linked O
to O
the O
North O
Korean O
regime O
, O
but O
maintains O
a O
set O
of O
common O
characteristics O

including O
motivation O

apart O

assess O
with O

confidence O
that O

months O
later O
, O
in O

2015 O
, O
we O
announced O
the O
discovery O
of O
Carbanak B-Malware
, I-Malware
a O
cyber-criminal O
gang O
that O
used O

to O
steal O
millions O
of O

Today O
at O
the O
Security B-Organization
Analyst I-Organization
Summit I-Organization
( O
SAS O

) O
, O
Kaspersky B-Organization
Lab I-Organization
is O
announcing O
the O
discovery O
of O
two O
new O
gangs O
engaged O
in O
APT-style B-Malware
bank O
robberies O
– O
Metel B-Malware
and O
GCMAN B-Malware
– O
and O
the O
reemergence O
of O
the O
Carbanak B-Malware
group O
with O
new O
targets O
in O
its O
sights O
. O

In O
2015 O
, O
Kaspersky B-Organization
Lab I-Organization
researchers O
conducted O
Incident O
Response O
for O
29 O
organizations O
located O
in O
Russia O
and O
infected O
by O
these O
three O
groups O
. O

Kaspersky B-Organization
Lab I-Organization
is O
releasing O
crucial O
Indicators O
of O
Compromise O
( O
IOCs O
) O
and O
other O
data O
to O
help O
organizations O
search O
for O
traces O
of O
these O
attack O
groups O
in O
their O
corporate O
networks O
. O

In O
all O
, O
Kaspersky B-Organization
Lab I-Organization
discovered O
Metel B-Malware
in O
more O
than O
30 O
financial O
institutions O
. O

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
that O
this O
threat O
is O
far O
more O
widespread O
and O
we O
urge O
financial O
institutions O
around O
the O
world O
to O
scan O
their O
networks O
for O
signs O
of O
the O
Metel B-Malware
malware O
. O

A O
second O
group O
, O
which O
we O
call O
GCMAN B-Malware
because O
the O
malware O
is O
based O
on O
code O
compiled O
on O
the O
GCC B-System
compiler O
, O
emerged O
recently O
using O
similar O
techniques O
to O
the O
Metel B-Organization
Group I-Organization
to O
infect O
banking O
institutions O
and O
attempt O
to O
transfer O
money O
to O
e-currency O
services O
. O

Our O
investigations O
revealed O
that O
the O
attackers O
drove O
around O
several O
cities O
in O
Russia O
, O
stealing O
money O
from O
ATMs O
belonging O
to O
different O
banks O
. O

Once O
inside O
the O
network O
, O
the O
GCMAN O
group O
uses O
legitimate O
and O
penetration O
testing O
tools O
such O
as O
Putty O
, O
VNC O
, O
and O
Meterpreter O
for O
lateral O
movement O
. O

Our O
investigation O
revealed O
an O
attack O
where O
the O
GCMAN B-Malware
group O
then O
planted O
a O
cron O
script O
into O
bank O
's O
server O
, O
sending O
financial O
transactions O
at O
the O
rate O
of O
$200 O
per O
minute O
. O

The O
GCMAN B-Organization
group O
used O
an O
MS B-System
SQL I-System
injection O
in O
commercial O
software O
running O
on O
one O
of O
bank O
's O
public O
web O
services O
, O
and O
about O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
later O
, O
they O
came O
back O
to O
cash O
out O
. O

During O
that O
time O
they O
poked O
70 O
internal O
hosts O
, O
compromised O
56 O
accounts O
, O
making O
their O
way O
from O
139 O
attack O
sources O
( O
TOR O
and O
compromised O
home O

) O
. O

However O
, O
in O
September O
last O
year O
, O
our O
friends O
at O
CSIS B-Organization
published O
a O
blog O
detailing O
a O
new O
Carbanak B-Malware
variant O
affecting O
one O
of O
its O
customers O
. O

Kaspersky B-Organization

responded O
to O
three O
financial O
institutions O
in O
Russia O
that O
were O
infected O
with O
the O
GCMAN B-Malware
malware O
. O

In O
one O
remarkable O
case O
, O
the O
Carbanak B-Malware
2.0 I-Malware
gang O
used O
its O
access O
to O
a O
financial O
institution O
that O
stores O

about O

to O
change O
the O

that O
the O

were O
most O

the O

In O
all O
of O
these O

, O
the O
Lazarus B-Malware
utilized O
similar O
toolsets O
, O
including O
KillDisk B-Vulnerability
that O
was O
executed O
on O

. O

We O
are O
confident O
this O
KillDisk B-Malware
malware O
was O
deployed O
by O
Lazarus B-Malware
, I-Malware
rather O
than O
by O
another O
, O
unrelated O
attacker O
. O

This O
recent O
attack O
against O
an O
online O
casino O
in O
Central O
America O
suggests O
that O
hacking O
tools O
from O
the O

are O
recompiled O
with O
every O
attack O
( O
we O
didn't O
see O
these O
exact O
samples O
anywhere O

) O
. O

Utilizing O
KillDisk B-Malware
in O
the O
attack O
scenario O
most O
likely O
served O
one O
of O
two O
purposes O
: O
the O
attackers O
covering O
their O
tracks O
after O
an O
espionage O
operation O
, O
or O
it O
was O
used O
directly O
for O

Today O
we'd O
like O
to O
share O
some O
of O
our O
findings O
, O
and O
add O
something O
new O
to O
what O
's O
currently O
common O
knowledge O
about O
Lazarus B-Malware
Group I-Organization
activities O
, O
and O
their O
connection O
to O
the O
much O
talked O
about O
February O
2016 O
incident O
, O
when O
an O
unknown O
attacker O
attempted O
to O
steal O
up O
to O
$851M O
USD O
from O
Bangladesh B-Organization
Central I-Organization
Bank I-Organization
. I-Organization

Since O
the O
Bangladesh O
incident O
there O
have O
been O
just O
a O
few O
articles O
explaining O
the O
connection O
between O
Lazarus B-Organization
Group I-Organization
and O
the O
Bangladesh O
bank O
heist O
. O

However O
, O
from O
this O
it O
's O
only O
clear O
that O
Lazarus B-Malware
might O
have O
attacked O
Polish O
banks O
. O

Symantec B-Organization
also O
confirmed O
seeing O
the O
Lazarus B-Malware
wiper O
tool O
in O
Poland O
at O
one O
of O
their O
customers O
. O

Considering O
that O
the O
afterhack O
publications O
by O
the O
media O
mentioned O
that O
the O
investigation O
stumbled O
upon O
three O
different O
attackers O
, O
it O
was O
not O
obvious O
whether O
Lazarus B-Malware
was O
the O
one O
responsible O
for O
the O
fraudulent O
SWIFT O
transactions O
, O
or O
if O
Lazarus B-Malware
had O
in O
fact O
developed O
its O
own O
malware O
to O
attack O
banks O
' O
systems O
. O

We O
would O
like O
to O
add O
some O
strong O
facts O
that O
link O
some O
attacks O
on O
banks O
to O
Lazarus B-Malware
, I-Malware
and O
share O
some O
of O
our O
own O
findings O
as O
well O
as O
shed O
some O
light O
on O
the O
recent O
TTPs O
used O
by O
the O
attacker O
, O
including O
some O
yet O
unpublished O
details O
from O
the O
attack O
in O
Europe O
in O
2017 O
. O

Lazarus B-Malware
attacks O
are O
not O
a O
local O
problem O
and O
clearly O
the O
group O
's O
operations O
span O
across O
the O
whole O
world O
. O

Lazarus B-Malware
was O
previously O
known O
to O
conduct O
cyberespionage O
and O
cybersabotage O
activities O
, O
such O
as O
attacks O
on O
Sony B-Organization
Pictures I-Organization
Entertainment I-Organization
with O
volumes O
of O
internal O
data O
leaked O
, O
and O
many O
system O
harddrives O
in O
the O
company O
wiped O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Lazarus B-Organization
Group I-Organization
is O
very O
large O
and O
works O
mainly O
on O
infiltration O
and O
espionage O
operations O
, O
while O
a O
substantially O
smaller O
units O
within O
the O
group O
, O
which O
we O
have O
dubbed O
Bluenoroff B-Malware
, I-Malware
is O
responsible O
for O
financial O
profit O
. O

Lazarus B-Malware
regrouped O
and O
rushed O
into O
new O
countries O
, O
selecting O
mostly O
poorer O
and O
less O
developed O
locations O
, O
hitting O
smaller O
banks O
because O
they O
are O
, O
apparently O
, O
easy O
prey O
. O

To O
date O
, O
the O
Lazarus B-Organization
group O
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
most O
successful O
in O
launching O
large O
scale O
operations O
against O
the O
financial O
industry O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Lazarus B-Malware
will O
remain O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
threats O
to O
the O
banking O
sector O
, O
finance O
, O
and O
trading O
companies O
, O
as O
well O
as O
casinos O
for O
the O
next O
few O
years O
. O

We O
believe O
Lazarus B-Malware
started O
this O
watering O
hole O
attack O
at O
the O
end O
of O
2016 O
after O
their O
other O
operation O
was O
interrupted O
in O
South O
East O
Asia O
. O

We O
believe O
they O
started O
this O
watering O
hole O
campaign O
at O
the O
end O
of O
2016 O
after O
their O
other O
operation O
was O
interrupted O
in O
South O
East O
Asia O
. O

A O
rudimentary O
but O
somewhat O
clever O
design O
, O
KiloAlfa B-Malware
provides O
keylogging O
capability O
for O
the O
Lazarus B-Organization
Group I-Organization
's I-Organization
collection O
of O
malicious O
tools O
. O

The O
design O
of O
KiloAlfa B-Malware
is O
broken O
down O
into O
two O
basic O
components O
: O
the O
persistence O
functionality O
and O
the O
keylogging O
functionality O
. O

The O
persistence O
functionality O
of O
KiloAlfa B-Malware
allows O
the O
malware O
to O
self-install O
on O
a O
victim O
's O
machine O
when O
activated O
( O
described O
below O
) O
. O

Evidence O
suggest O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-Organization
Group I-Organization
uses O
compromised O
infrastructure O
as O
the O
public-facing O
touchpoint O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
their O
malware O
samples O
. O

PapaAlfa B-Malware
is O
believed O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
proxy O
malware O
components O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-Organization
Group I-Organization
uses O
to O
hide O
the O
true O
command O
and O
control O
server O
( O
s O
) O
for O
operations O
. O

Rather O
, O
PapaAlfa B-Malware
could O
be O
considered O
a O
smart O
proxy O
due O
in O
part O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-Malware
can O
easily O
switch O
the O
backend O
destination O
address O
and O
port O
without O
having O
to O
reestablish O
control O
over O
the O
infected O
machine O
hosting O
the O
PapaAlfa B-Malware
malware O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
form O
factor O
, O
PapaAlfa B-Malware
comes O
in O
two O
flavors O
: O
service O
DLL O
and O
standalone O
executable O
. O

The O
IndiaBravo-PapaAlfa B-Indicator
installer O
is O
responsible O
for O
installing O
the O
service O
DLL O
variant O
. O

While O
the O
tools O
profiled O
in O
this O
report O
are O
not O
inherently O
malicious O
, O
their O
capabilities O
are O
nonetheless O
integral O
to O
the O
Lazarus B-Organization
Group I-Organization
's I-Organization
cyber O
operations O
, O
both O
espionage O
and O
destructive O
in O
nature O
, O
making O
them O
inherently O
dangerous O
to O
potential O
victims O
. O

These O
tools O
often O
lay O
the O
groundwork O
for O
further O
malicious O
activity O
, O
such O
as O
the O
targeting O
of O
antivirus O
capabilities O
and O
the O
disabling O
of O
firewalls O
, O
both O
of O
which O
are O
very O
fundamental O
defensive O
measures O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
like O
many O
other O
identified O
Lazarus B-Malware
Group I-Malware
families O
, O
these O
tools O
showcase O
the O
group O
's O
creative O
solutions O
, O
such O
as O
the O

which O
makes O

One O
of O
the O

is O
that O
the O
amount O
of O

significantly O
increased O
after O
we O
published O
our O

, O
resulting O
in O
many O

Our O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
malware O
authors O
created O
Emissary B-Malware
as O
early O
as O
2009 O
, O
which O
suggests O
that O
threat O
actors O
have O
relied O
on O
this O
tool O
as O
a O
payload O
in O
cyber-espionage O
attacks O
for O
many O
years O
. O

While O
it O
lacks O
more O
advanced O
functionality O
like O

, O
it O
is O
still O
able O
to O
carry O
out O
most O
tasks O
desired O
by O

actors O
: O
exfiltration O

The O

that O
the O

first O
created O
( O

) O
in O
May O
2009 O
and O
quickly O
received O
an O
update O
that O
resulted O
in O
version O
1.1 O
in O
June O
2009 O
. O

Between O
August O
and O
November O
2015 O
the O

, O
5.1 O
, O
5.3 O

in O
a O
much O
more O
rapid O
succession O
compared O
to O

in O
earlier O

. O

Version O

received O
one O

in O
October O
2013 O
before O

While O
this O
may O
be O

the O

that O
it O

have O
increased O
over O

APT10 B-Malware
withdrew O
from O

targeting O
using O
Poison B-Malware
Ivy I-Malware
in O
2013 O
and O
conducted O
its O
first O
known O
retooling O
operation O
, O
upgrading O
its O
capabilities O
and O
replatforming O
to O
use O
PlugX B-Malware
. I-Malware

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
that O
this O
is O
due O
to O
the O
release O
of O
the O
2013 O
FireEye B-System
report O
. O

Our O
report O
will O
detail O
the O
most O
recent O
campaigns O
conducted O
by O
APT10 B-Malware
, I-Malware
including O
the O
sustained O
targeting O
of O
MSPs O
, O
which O
we O
have O
named O
Operation B-System
Cloud B-Malware
Hopper I-Malware
, I-Malware
and O
the O
targeting O
of O
a O
number O
of O
Japanese O
institutions O
. O

MSPs O
therefore O
represent O
a O
high-payoff O
target O
for O
espionagefocused O
threat O
actors O
such O
as O
APT10 B-Malware
. I-Malware

Given O
the O
level O
of O
client O
network O
access O
MSPs O
have O
, O
once O
APT10 B-Malware
has O
gained O
access O
to O
a O
MSP O
, O
it O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
relatively O
straightforward O
to O
exploit O
this O
and O
move O
laterally O
onto O
the O
networks O
of O
potentially O
thousands O
of O
other O
victims O
. O

This O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
would O
provide O
access O
to O
a O
larger O
amount O
of O
intellectual O
property O
and O
sensitive O
data O
. O

APT10 B-Malware
has O
been O
observed O
to O
exfiltrate O
stolen O
intellectual O
property O
via O
the O
MSPs O
, O
hence O
evading O
local O
network O
defences O
. O

The O
command O
and O
control O
( O
C2 O
) O
infrastructure O
chosen O
by O
APT10 B-System
for O
Operation O
Cloud B-System
Hopper I-System
is O
predominantly O
referenced O
using O
dynamic-DNS O
domains O
. O

Several O
of O
these O
provide O
enterprise O
services O
or O
cloud O
hosting O
, O
supporting O
our O
assessment O
that O
APT10 B-Malware
are O
almost O
certainly O
targeting O
MSPs O
. O

The O
13th O
FYP O
was O
released O
in O
March O
2016 O
and O
the O
sectors O
and O
organisations O
known O
to O
be O
targeted O
by O
APT10 B-Malware
are O
broadly O
in O
line O
with O
the O
strategic O
aims O
documented O
in O
this O
plan O
. O

These O
aims O
outlined O
in O
the O
FYP O
will O
largely O
dictate O
the O
growth O
of O

are O
, O
therefore O
, O
likely O
to O
also O
form O
part O
of O
Chinese O
companies O
' O
business O
strategies O
. O

APT10 B-Malware
has O
, O
in O
the O
past O
, O
primarily O
been O
known O
for O
its O
targeting O
of O
government O
and O
US O
defence O
industrial O
base O
organisations O
, O
with O
the O
earliest O
known O
date O
of O
its O
activity O
being O
in O
December O
2009 O
. O

Observed O
APT10 B-Malware
targeting O
is O
in O
line O
with O
many O
of O
the O
historic O
compromises O
we O
have O
outlined O
previously O
as O
originating O
from O
China O
. O

In O
line O
with O
commonly O
used O
APT O
actor O
methodologies O
, O
the O
threat O
actor O
aligns O
its O
decoy O
documents O
to O
a O
topic O
of O
interest O
relevant O
to O
the O
recipient O
. O

This O
section O
details O
changes O
made O
to O
APT10 B-Malware
tools O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
( O
TTPs O
) O
post-2014 O
, O
following O
its O
shift O
from O
Poison B-Malware
Ivy I-Malware
to O
PlugX B-Malware
. I-Malware

We O
have O
observed O
that O
in O
cases O
where O
APT10 B-Malware
has O
infiltrated O
a O
target O
via O
an O
MSP O
, O
it O
continues O
to O
use O
the O
MSPs O
credentials O
. O

In O
order O
to O
gain O
any O
further O
credentials O
, O
APT10 B-Malware
will O
usually O
deploy O
credential O
theft O
tools O
such O
as O
mimikatz B-Vulnerability
or O
PwDump B-Vulnerability
, I-Vulnerability
sometimes O
using O
DLL O
load O
order O
hijacking O
, O
to O
use O
against O
a O
domain O
controller O
, O
explained O
further O
in O
Annex O
B O
. O

APT10 B-Malware
achieves O
persistence O
on O
its O
targets O
primarily O
by O
using O
scheduled O
tasks O
or O
Windows B-System
services O
in O
order O
to O
ensure O
the O
malware O
remains O
active O
regardless O
of O
system O
reboots O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
compromising O
high O
value O
domain O
controllers O
and O
security O
servers O
, O
the O
threat O
actor O
has O
also O
been O
observed O
identifying O
and O
subsequently O
installing O
malware O
on O
low O
profile O
systems O
that O
provide O
non-critical O
support O
functions O
to O
the O
business O
, O
and O
are O
thus O
less O
likely O
to O
draw O
the O
attention O
of O
system O
administrators O
. O

In O
the O
majority O
of O
instances O
APT10 B-Malware
used O
either O
a O
reverse O
shell O
or O
RDP O
connection O
to O
install O
its O
malware O
; O
the O
actor O
also O
uses O
these O
methods O
to O
propagate O
across O
the O
network O
. O

The O
tactical O
malware O
, O
historically O
EvilGrab B-Malware
, I-Malware
and O
now O
ChChes B-Malware
( O
and O
likely O
also O
RedLeaves B-Malware
) I-Malware
, I-Malware
is O
designed O
to O
be O
lightweight O
and O
disposable O
, O
often O
being O
delivered O
through O
spear O
phishing O
. O

Once O
executed O
, O
tactical O
malware O
contains O
the O
capability O
to O
profile O
the O
network O
and O
manoeuvre O
through O
it O
to O
identify O
a O
key O
system O
of O
interest O
. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
APT10 B-Malware
use O
DLL O
search O
order O
hijacking O
and O
sideloading O
, O
to O
execute O
some O
modified O
versions O
of O
open-source O
tools O
. O

For O
example O
, O
PwC B-Organization
UK I-Organization
has O
observed O
APT10 B-Malware
compiling O
DLLs O
out O
of O
tools O
, O
such O
as O
Mimikatz B-Malware
and O
PwDump6 B-Malware
, I-Malware
and O
using O
legitimate O
, O

software O
, O
such O
as O
Windows B-System

to O
load O
the O
malicious O
payloads O
. O

During O
our O
analysis O
of O
victim O

, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
observe O
APT10 B-Malware
once O
again O
initiate O
a O
retooling O
cycle O
in O
late O
2016 O
. O

We O
observed O

In O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
the O

, O
we O
have O
observed O
two O
different O
variations O
of O
the O
Helminth B-Malware

, O
one O
written O
in O
VBScript B-System

also O
reported O
on O
these O

The O
executable O
variant O
of O

is O
installed O
with O
a O
dropper O
Trojan O
that O
we O
are O
tracking O
as O
the O
HerHer B-Malware

The O
Helminth B-Malware
executable O
variant O
is O
very O
similar O
in O
functionality O
to O
its O
script-based O
counterpart O
, O
as O
it O
also O
communicates O
with O
its O
C2 O
server O
using O
both O
HTTP O

Helminth O
executable O

This O

that O

are O
not O

While O
researching O
the O

, O
we O
have O
seen O
two O
waves O
of O
targeted O
attacks O
on O
Saudi O
Arabian O
organizations O
in O
which O
a O
group O
of O
threat O
actors O
delivered O
the O
Helminth B-Malware
Trojan I-Malware
as O
a O
payload O
. O

The O
two O
variants O
of O
Helminth B-Malware
do O
require O
different O
delivery O
methods O
, O
with O
the O
script O
variant O
relying O
on O
an O
Excel B-System
spreadsheet O
for O
delivery O
, O
while O
the O
executable O
variant O
is O
more O
traditional O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
can O
be O
installed O
without O
a O

. O

Since O
our O
first O
published O
analysis O
of O
the O
OilRig B-Malware

in O
May O
2016 O
, O
we O
have O
continued O
to O
monitor O
this O
group O
for O
new O
activity O
. O

Additionally O
, O
the O
scope O
of O
organizations O
targeted O
by O
this O
group O
has O
expanded O
to O
not O

also O
a O

The O
group O
behind O
the O

campaign O
continues O
to O
leverage O
spear-phishing O
emails O
with O
malicious O
Microsoft B-System

to O
compromise O
victims O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
these O

, O
multiple O
Qatari O
organizations O
were O
the O
subject O
to O
spear O
phishing O
attacks O
carrying O
Helminth B-Malware
samples O
earlier O
this O
year O
. O

While O
the O

deployed O
is O
not O
terribly O
sophisticated O
, O
it O
uses O
techniques O
such O
as O
DNS O
command O

that O
allows O
it O
to O
stay O

Less O

after O
Microsoft B-Organization
issued O

for O
CVE-2017-11882 B-Vulnerability
on O
Nov. O
14 O
, O
2017 O

We O
assess O
this O

was O
carried O
out O
by O

suspected O
Iranian O
cyber O

group O
, O
whom O
we O
refer O
to O
as O
APT34 B-Malware
, I-Malware
using O
a O
custom O

This O

We O
assess O
that O

We O
believe O
APT34 B-Malware

long-term O
cyber O
espionage O
operation O
largely O
focused O
on O
reconnaissance O
efforts O

Finally O
, O
some O

are O
also O
infected O
with O
other O
Turla-related B-Malware
malware O
such O
as O
ComRAT B-Malware
or O
Gazer B-Malware
. I-Malware

Kaspersky B-Organization
Lab I-Organization
documented O
this O
behavior O
in O
2014 O
. O

It O
is O
not O
a O
new O
tactic O
for O
Turla B-Malware
to O
rely O
on O
fake O
Flash B-System
installers O
to O
try O
to O
trick O
the O
user O
to O
install O
one O
of O
their O
backdoors O
. O

Turla B-Malware
operators O
could O
use O
an O
already-compromised O
machine O
in O
the O
network O
of O
the O
victim O
's O
organization O
to O
perform O
a O
local O
MitM B-Malware
attack O
. O

Our O
January O
2018 O
white O
paper O
was O
the O
first O
public O
analysis O
of O
a O
Turla B-Organization
campaign O
called O
Mosquito B-Malware
. I-Malware

It O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Turla B-Malware
has O
used O
generic O
tools O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
we O
have O
seen O
the O
group O
using O
open-source O
password O
dumpers O
such O
as O
Mimikatz B-Malware
. I-Malware

Starting O
in O
March O
2018 O
, O
we O
observed O
a O
significant O
change O
in O
the O
campaign O
: O
it O
now O
leverages O
the O
open O
source O
exploitation O
framework O
Metasploit B-System
before O
dropping O
the O
custom O
Mosquito B-Malware
backdoor O
. O

Even O
an O
experienced O
user O
can O
be O
fooled O
by O
downloading O
a O
malicious O
file O
that O
is O
apparently O
from O
adobe.com B-Organization
, I-Organization
since O
the O
URL O
and O
the O
IP O
address O
correspond O
to O
Adobe B-Organization
's I-Organization
legitimate O
infrastructure O
. O

However O
, O
to O
our O
knowledge O
, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
Turla B-Organization
has O
used O
Metasploit B-System
as O
a O
first O
stage O
backdoor O
, O
instead O
of O
relying O
on O
one O
of O
its O
own O
tools O
such O
as O
Skipper B-Organization
. I-Organization

Traffic O
was O
intercepted O
on O
a O
node O
between O
the O
end O
machine O
and O
the O
Adobe B-Organization
servers O
, O
allowing O
Turla B-Malware
's I-Malware
operators O
to O
replace O
the O
legitimate O
Flash B-System
executable O
with O
a O
trojanized O
version O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
March O
2018 O
, O
as O
part O
of O
our O
regular O
tracking O
of O
Turla B-Malware
's I-Malware
activities O
, O
we O
observed O
some O
changes O
in O
the O
Mosquito B-Malware
campaign O
. O

In O
this O
post O
, O
we O
have O
presented O
the O
evolutions O
of O
the O
Turla B-Malware
Mosquito I-Malware
campaign O
over O
the O
last O
few O
months O
. O

Primary O
targets O
for O
this O
adversary O
are O
in O
the O
government O
, O
aerospace O
, O
NGO O
, O
defense O
, O
cryptology O
and O
education O
sectors O
. O

Turla B-Malware
's I-Malware
campaign O
still O
relies O
on O
a O
fake O
Flash B-System
installer O
but O
, O
instead O
of O
directly O
dropping O
the O
two O
malicious O
DLLs O
, O
it O
executes O
a O
Metasploit O
shellcode O
and O
drops O
, O
or O
downloads O
from O
Google B-System
Drive I-System
, I-System
a O
legitimate O
Flash B-System
installer O
. O

The O
Turla B-Malware
espionage O
group O
has O
been O
targeting O
various O
institutions O
for O
many O
years O
. O

Recently O
, O
we O
found O
several O
new O
versions O
of O
Carbon B-Malware
, I-Malware
a O
second O
stage O
backdoor O
in O
the O
Turla B-Malware
group O
arsenal O
. O

The O
Turla B-Malware
group O
is O
known O
to O
be O
painstaking O
and O
work O
in O
stages O
, O
first O
doing O
reconnaissance O
on O
their O
victims' O
systems O
before O
deploying O
their O
most O
sophisticated O
tools O
such O
as O
Carbon O
. O

Kaspersky B-System
APT I-System
Intelligence I-System
Reporting I-System
subscription O
, O
customers O
received O
an O
update O
in O
mid-February O
2017 O
. O

Like O
previous O
Turla B-Malware
activity O
, O
WhiteBear B-Malware
leverages O
compromised O
websites O
and O
hijacked O
satellite O
connections O
for O
command O
and O
control O
( O
C2 O
) O
infrastructure O
. O

WhiteBear B-Malware
is O
a O
parallel O
project O
or O
second O
stage O
of O
the O
Skipper B-Malware
Turla I-Malware
cluster O
of O
activity O
documented O
in O
another O
private O
intelligence O
report O
" O
Skipper B-Malware
Turla I-Malware
– O
the O
White B-System
Atlas I-System
framework O
" O
from O
mid-2016 O
. O

However O
, O
despite O
the O
similarities O
to O
previous O
Turla B-Malware
campaigns O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
WhiteBear B-Malware
is O
a O
distinct O
project O
with O
a O
separate O
focus O
. O

From O
February O
to O
September O
2016 O
, O
WhiteBear B-Malware
activity O
was O
narrowly O
focused O
on O
embassies O
and O
consular O
operations O
around O
the O
world O
. O

Continued O
WhiteBear B-Malware
activity O
later O
shifted O
to O
include O
defense-related O
organizations O
into O
June O
2017 O
. O

All O
of O
these O
early O
WhiteBear B-Malware
targets O
were O
related O
to O
embassies O
and O
diplomatic/foreign O
affair O
organizations O
. O

Thus O
, O
Turla B-Organization
operators O
had O
access O
to O
some O
highly O
sensitive O
information O
( O
such O
as O
emails O
sent O
by O
the O
German O
Foreign O
Office B-Organization
staff O
) O
for O
almost O
a O
year O
. O

Our O
investigation O
also O
led O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
dozens O
of O
email O
addresses O
registered O
by O
Turla B-Organization
operators O
for O
this O
campaign O
and O
used O
to O
receive O
exfiltrated O
data O
from O
the O
victims O
. O

It O
mainly O
targets O
Microsoft B-System
Outlook I-System
, I-System
a O
widely O
used O
mail O
client O
, O
but O
also O
targets O
The B-Malware
Bat! I-Malware
, I-Malware
a O
mail O
client O
very O
popular O
in O
Eastern O
Europe O
. O

First O
, O
Turla B-Malware
steals O
emails O
by O
forwarding O
all O
outgoing O
emails O
to O
the O
attackers O
. O

We O
identified O
several O
European O
governments O
and O
defense O
companies O
compromised O
with O
this O
group O
. O

What O
actually O
happens O
is O
that O
the O
malware O
is O
able O
to O
decode O
data O
from O
the O
PDF O
documents O
and O
interpret O
it O
as O
commands O
for O
the O
backdoor O
. O

In O
early O
2018 O
, O
multiple O
media O
claimed O
that O
Turla B-Malware
operators O
used O
mail O
attachments O
to O
control O
infected O
machines O
. O

As O
detailed O
in O
the O
previous O
section O
, O
this O
malware O
is O
able O
to O
manipulate O
and O
exfiltrate O
emails O
. O

To O
our O
knowledge O
, O
Turla B-Organization
is O
the O
only O
espionage O
group O
that O
currently O
uses O
a O
backdoor O
entirely O
controlled O
by O
emails O
, O
and O
more O
specifically O
via O
PDF O
attachments O
. O

The O
attackers O
first O
infected O
in O
March O
2017 O
. O

Our O
research O
shows O
that O
compromised O
organizations O
are O
at O
risk O
of O
not O
only O
being O
spied O
on O
by O
the O
Turla B-Malware
group O
who O
planted O
the O
backdoor O
, O
but O
also O
by O
other O
attackers O
. O

The O
developers O
refer O
to O
this O
tool O
by O
the O
name O
Kazuar B-Malware
, I-Malware
which O
is O
a O
Trojan O
written O
using O
the O
Microsoft.NET B-System
Framework I-System
that O
offers O
actors O
complete O
access O
to O
compromised O
systems O
targeted O
by O
its O
operator O
. O

We O
suspect O
the O
Kazuar B-Malware
tool O
may O
be O
linked O
to O
the O
Turla B-Malware
threat O
actor O
group O
( O
also O
known O
as O
Uroburos B-Malware
and O
Snake B-Malware
) I-Malware
, I-Malware
who O
have O
been O
reported O
to O
have O
compromised O
embassies O
, O
defense O
contractors O
, O
educational O
institutions O
, O
and O
research O
organizations O
across O
the O
globe O
. O

This O
is O
also O
a O
full-featured O
backdoor O
controlled O
by O
email O
, O
and O
which O
can O
work O
independently O
of O
any O
other O
Turla B-Malware
component O
. O

A O
hallmark O
of O
Turla B-Malware
operations O
is O
iterations O
of O
their O
tools O
and O
code O
lineage O
in O
Kazuar O
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
at O
least O
2005 O
. O

If O
the O
hypothesis O
is O
correct O
and O
the O
Turla B-Malware
threat O
group O
is O
using O
Kazuar B-Malware
, I-Malware
we O
believe O
they O
may O
be O
using O
it O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
Carbon B-Malware
and O
its O
derivatives O
. O

We O
used O
a O
combination O
of O
tools O
such O
as O
NoFuserEx B-Malware
, I-Malware
ConfuserEx B-Malware
Fixer I-System
, I-System
ConfuserEx B-Malware
Switch O
Killer B-System
, I-System
and O
de4d0t O
in O
order O
to O
deobfuscate O
the O
code O
for O
in O
depth O
analysis O
. O

Kazuar B-Malware
generates O
its O
mutex O
by O
using O
a O
process O
that O
begins O
with O
obtaining O
the O
MD5 O
hash O
of O
a O
string O
" O
[username]=>singleton-instance-mutex B-Indicator
" O
. O

The O
subject O
is O
a O
series O
of O
targeted O
attacks O
against O
private O
companies O
. O

e B-Indicator
uncovered O
the O
activity O
of O
a O
hacking O
group O
which O
has O
Chinese O
origins O
. O

Also O
, O
by O
creating O
this O
type O
of O
API O
access O
, O
Turla B-Malware
could O
use O
one O
accessible O
server O
as O
a O
single O
point O
to O
dump O
data O
to O
and O
exfiltrate O
data O
from O
. O

According O
to O
our O
estimations O
, O
this O
group O
has O
been O
active O
for O
several O
years O
and O
specializes O
in O
cyberattacks O
against O
the O
online O
video O
game O
industry O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
analysis O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
threat O
actors O
may O
compile O
Windows B-System
and O
Unix B-System
based O
payloads O
using O
the O
same O
code O
to O
deploy O
Kazuar B-Malware
against O
both O
platforms O
. O

in O
these O
sectors O
. O

APT5 B-Malware
has O
been O
active O
since O
at O
least O
2007 O
. O

APT5 B-Malware
has O
targeted O
or O
breached O
organizations O
across O
multiple O
industries O
, O
but O
its O
focus O
appears O
to O
be O
on O
telecommunications O
and O
technology O
companies O
, O
especially O
information O
about O
satellite O
communications O
. O

APT5 B-Malware
targeted O
the O
network O
of O
an O
electronics O
firm O
that O
sells O
products O
for O
both O
industrial O
and O
military O
applications O
. O

The O

subsequently O
stole O

the O

a O
national O

In O
one O
case O
in O
late O
2014 O
, O
APT5 B-Organization
breached O
the O
network O
of O
an O
international O
telecommunications O
company O

The O
group O
used O

who O
manages O
the O

of O
some O
of O
Southeast O
Asia O

major O
telecommunications O

We O
suspect O
that O
the O

Nearly O
a O
month O
later O
, O
security O

are O
now O
shining O
a O
bright O
light O
on O
the O
alert O
and O
the O
mysterious O
group O
behind O
the O

. O

The O
attacks O
discussed O
in O
this O

are O
related O
to O
an O
APT B-Malware
campaign O
commonly O
referred O
to O
as O
" O
th3bug B-Vulnerability

, O
named O
for O
the O

Over O
the O
summer O
they O
compromised O
several O
sites O
, O
including O
a O
well-known O
Uyghur O
website O
written O
in O
that O
native O
language O
. O

In O
contrast O
to O
many O
other O
APT O
campaigns O
, O
which O
tend O
to O
rely O
heavily O
on O
spear O
phishing O
to O
gain O
victims O
, O
" O
th3bug B-Malware
" O
is O
known O
for O
compromising O
legitimate O

to O
frequent O
. O

While O
we O
were O
unable O
to O
recover O
the O
initial O
vulnerability O
used O
, O
it O
is O
possibly O
the O
same O
CVE-2014-0515 B-Vulnerability
Adobe B-System
Flash I-System
exploit O
first O
reported O
by O
Cisco B-Organization

July O
. O

However O
, O
to O
increase O
success O
rates O
APT20 B-Malware
can O
use O
zero-day O
exploits O
, O
so O
even O
a O
properly O
patched O

would O
be O
compromised O
. O

Our O
direct O
observation O
of O
in-the-wild O
spearphishing O
attacks O
staged O
by O
the O
Bahamut B-Malware
group O
have O
been O
solely O
attempts O
to O
deceive O
targets O
into O
providing O
account O
passwords O
through O
impersonation O
of O
notices O
from O
platform O
providers O
. O

Bahamut B-Malware
was O
first O
noticed O
when O
it O
targeted O
a O
Middle O
Eastern O
human O
rights O
activist O
in O
the O
first O
week O
of O
January O
2017 O
. O

Later O
that O
month O
, O
the O
same O
tactics O
and O
patterns O
were O
seen O
in O
attempts O
against O
an O
Iranian O
women O
's O
activist O
– O
an O
individual O
commonly O
targeted O
by O
Iranian O
actors O
, O
such O
as O
Charming B-Malware
Kitten I-Malware
and O
the O
Sima B-Malware
campaign O
documented O
in O
our O
2016 O
Black B-Malware

talk O
. O

In O
June O
we O
published O
on O
a O
previously O
unknown O
group O
we O
named O
" O
Bahamut B-Malware
" O
, O
a O
strange O
campaign O
of O
phishing O
and O
malware O
apparently O
focused O
on O
the O
Middle O
East O
and O
South O
Asia O
. O

Once O
inside O
a O
network O
, O
APT40 B-Malware
uses O
credential-harvesting O
tools O
to O
gain O
usernames O
and O
passwords O
, O
allowing O
it O
to O
expand O
its O
reach O
across O
the O
network O
and O
move O
laterally O
through O
an O
environment O
as O
it O
moves O
to O
towards O
the O
ultimate O
goal O
of O
stealing O
data O
. O

Bahamut B-Organization
was O
shown O
to O
be O
resourceful O
, O
not O
only O
maintaining O
their O
own O
Android B-System
malware O
but O
running O
propaganda O
sites O
, O
although O
the O
quality O
of O
these O
activities O
varied O
noticeably O
. O

In O
June O
we O
published O
on O
a O
previously O
unknown O
group O
we O
named O
" O
Bahamut B-Malware
" O
, O
a O
strange O
campaign O
of O
phishing O
and O

apparently O
focused O
on O
the O
Middle O
East O
and O
South O

. O

Several O
times O
, O
APT5 B-Malware
has O
targeted O
organizations O
and O
personnel O
based O
in O
Southeast O
Asia O
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
same O
week O
of O
September O
a O
series O
of O
spearphishing O
attempts O
once O
again O
targeted O
a O
set O
of O
otherwise O
unrelated O
individuals O
, O
employing O
the O
same O
tactics O
as O
before O
. O

Our O
primary O
contribution O
in O
this O
update O
is O
to O
implicate O
Bahamut B-Organization
in O
what O
are O
likely O
counterterrorism-motivated O
surveillance O
operations O
, O
and O
to O
further O
affirm O
our O
belief O
that O
the O
group O
is O
a O
hacker-for-hire O
operation O
. O

As O
we O
wrote O
then O
, O
compared O
to O
Kingphish B-Malware
, I-Malware
Bahamut B-Organization
operates O
as O
though O
it O
were O
a O
generation O
ahead O
in O
terms O
of O
professionalism O
and O
ambition O
. O

In O
the O
Bahamut O
report O
, O
we O
discussed O
two O
domains O
found O
within O
our O
search O
that O
were O
linked O
with O
a O
custom O
Android B-System
malware O
agent O
. O

After O
the O
publication O
of O
the O
original O
report O
, O
these O
sites O
were O
taken O
offline O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
one O
agent O
was O
even O
updated O
a O
six O
days O
prior O
to O
our O
post O
( O
the O

in O

over O
the O
disputed O

As O
a O
result O
, O
it O
is O
already O
flagged O
as O
Bahamut B-Malware
by O
antivirus O
engines O
. O

Our O
initial O
observation O
of O
the O
Bahamut B-Malware
group O
originated O
from O
in-the-wild O
attempts O
to O
deceive O
targets O
into O
providing O
account O
passwords O
through O
impersonation O
of O
platform O
providers O
. O

One O
curious O
trait O
of O
Bahamut B-Organization
is O
that O
it O
develops O
fully-functional O
applications O
in O
support O
of O
its O
espionage O
activities O
, O
rather O
than O
push O
nonfunctional O
fake O
apps O
or O
bundle O
malware O
with O
legitimate O
software O
. O

Curiously O
, O
Bahamut B-Malware
appears O
to O
track O
password O
attempts O
in O
response O
to O
failed O
phishing O
attempts O
or O
to O
provoke O
the O
target O
to O
provide O
more O
passwords O
. O

Bahamut B-Malware
spearphishing O
attempts O
have O
also O
been O
accompanied O
with O
SMS O
messages O
purporting O
to O
be O
from O

about O

issues O
on O
their O
account O
, O
including O
a O
class O
0 O
message O
or O
" O
flash O
text O
" O
. O

These O
text O
messages O
did O
not O
include O
links O
but O
are O
intended O
to O
build O
credibility O
around O
the O
fake O
service O
notifications O
later O
sent O
to O
the O
target O
's O
email O
address O
. O

We O
have O
not O

evidence O
of O
Bahamut B-Malware
engaging O
in O
crime O
or O
operating O
outside O
its O
limited O
geographic O
domains O
, O
although O
this O
narrow O
perspective O
could O
be O
accounted O
for O
by O
its O
compartmentalization O
of O
operations O
. O

Thus O
far O
, O
Bahamut B-Malware
's I-Malware
campaigns O
have O
appeared O
to O
be O
primarily O
espionage O
or O
information O
operations O

The O
developers O
designed O
Bookworm B-Malware
to O
be O
a O
modular O
Trojan O
not O
limited O
to O
just O
the O
initial O
architecture O

Trojan O
, O
as O
Bookworm B-Malware
can O
also O
load O
additional O
modules O
provided O
by O
the O
C2 O

Although O
the O
developers O
of O
Bookworm B-Malware
have O
included O
only O
keylogging O
functionality O
in O
Bookworm B-Malware
as O
a O
core O
ability O
, O
as O
suggested O
in O

While O

we O
have O
observed O

actors O
deploying O
Bookworm B-Malware
primarily O
in O
attacks O
on O

, O
Bookworm B-Malware

obfuscate O
the O

The O

Unit B-Organization
42 I-Organization
recently O
published O
a O
blog O
on O
a O
newly O
identified O
Trojan O
called O
Bookworm B-Malware
, I-Malware
which O
discussed O
the O
architecture O
and O
capabilities O
of O
the O
malware O
and O
alluded O
to O
Thailand O
being O
the O
focus O
of O
the O
threat O
actors' O
campaigns O
. O

Leader B-Malware
is O
Bookworm B-Malware
's I-Malware
main O
module O
and O
controls O
all O
of O
the O
activities O
of O
the O
Trojan O
, O
but O
relies O
on O
the O
additional O
DLLs O
to O
provide O
specific O
functionality O
. O

The O
developers O
of O
Bookworm B-Malware
use O
these O
modules O
in O
a O
rather O
unique O
way O
, O
as O
the O
other O
embedded O
DLLs O
provide O
API O
functions O
for O
Leader O
to O
carry O
out O
its O
tasks O
. O

Unit O
42 O
does O
not O
have O
detailed O
targeting O
information O
for O
all O
known O
Bookworm B-Malware
samples O
, O
but O
we O
are O
aware O
of O
attempted O
attacks O
on O
at O
least O
two O
branches O
of O
government O
in O
Thailand O
. O

We O
speculate O
that O
other O
attacks O
delivering O
Bookworm B-Malware
were O
also O
targeting O
organizations O
in O
Thailand O
based O
on O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
associated O
decoys O
documents O
, O
as O
well O
as O
several O
of O
the O
dynamic O
DNS O
domain O
names O
used O
to O
host O
C2 O
servers O
that O
contain O
the O
words O
" O
Thai O
" O
or O
" O
Thailand O
" O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
likely O
threat O
actors O
will O
continue O
development O
Bookworm B-Malware
, I-Malware
and O
will O
continue O
to O
use O
it O
for O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
. O

Threat O
actors O
have O
delivered O
Bookworm B-Malware
as O
a O
payload O
in O
attacks O
on O
targets O
in O
Thailand O
. O

Analysis O
of O
compromised O
systems O
seen O
communicating O
with O
Bookworm B-Malware
C2 O
servers O
also O
confirms O
our O
speculation O
on O
targeting O
with O
a O
majority O
of O
systems O
existing O
within O
Thailand O
. O

As O
mentioned O
in O
our O
previous O
blog O
on O
Bookworm B-Malware
, I-Malware
the O
Trojan O
sends O
a O
static O
date O
string O
to O
the O
C2 O
server O
that O
we O
referred O
to O
as O
a O
campaign O
code O
. O

We O
believed O
that O
the O
actors O
would O
use O
this O
date O
code O
to O
track O
their O
attack O
campaigns O
; O
however O
, O
after O
continued O
analysis O
of O
the O
malware O
, O
we O
think O
these O
static O
dates O
could O
also O
be O
a O
build O
identifier O
for O
the O
Trojan O
. O

Threat O
actors O
may O
use O
the O
date O
string O
hardcoded O
into O
each O
Bookworm B-Malware
sample O
as O
a O
build O
identifier O
. O

A O
Trojan O
sending O
a O
build O
identifier O
to O
its O
C2 O
server O
is O
quite O
common O
, O
as O
it O
notifies O
the O
threat O
actors O
of O
the O
specific O
version O
of O
the O
Trojan O
in O
which O
they O
are O
interacting O
. O

Due O
to O
these O
changes O
without O
a O
new O
date O
string O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
date O
codes O
are O
used O
for O
campaign O
tracking O
rather O
than O
a O
Bookworm B-Malware
build O
identifier O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Bookworm B-Malware
samples O
use O
the O
static O
date O
string O
as O
campaign O
codes O
, O
which O
we O
used O
to O
determine O
the O
approximate O
date O
of O
each O
attack O
that O
we O
did O
not O
have O
detailed O
targeting O
information O
. O

Another O
decoy O

the O
Bookworm B-Malware

the O
observed O

, O
Unit B-Organization

The O
vast O

are O
within O
the O
Bangkok O

where O
a O

. O

Buhtrap B-Malware
has O
been O
active O
since O
2014 O
, O
however O
their O
first O
attacks O
against O
financial O
institutions O
were O
only O
detected O
in O
August O
2015 O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
the O
group O
is O
known O
to O
target O
Russian O
and O
Ukrainian O
banks O
. O

Buhtrap B-Malware
is O
the O
first O
hacker O
group O
using O
a O
network O
worm O
to O
infect O
the O
overall O
bank O
infrastructure O
that O
significantly O
increases O
the O
difficulty O
of O
removing O
all O
malicious O
functions O
from O
the O
network O
. O

Malicious O
programs O
intentionally O
scan O
for O
machines O
with O
an O
automated O
Bank-Customer O

of O
the O
Central O

If O
the O

then O
the O

contained O

We O
noticed O
that O
criminals O
were O
spreading O
Buhtrap B-Malware
using O
this O
method O
from O
May O
2015 O
to O
August O
2015 O
. O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
attackers O
used O
the O
same O
compromised O
websites O
to O
spread O
Buhtrap B-Malware
as O
those O
that O
had O
been O
used O
for O
the O
Corkow B-Malware
Trojan O
. O

Moreover O
, O
they O
used O
the O
same O
exploit O
kit O
Niteris B-Malware
as O
that O
in O
the O
Corkow O
case O
. O

Purportedly O
during O
one O
of O
the O
first O
attacks O
hackers O
intercepted O
the O
mailing O
list O
of O
the O
Anti-drop O
" O
club O
and O
created O
a O
specific O
phishing O
email O
for O
its O
members O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
still O
widely O
used O
, O
notably O
in O
Russia O
. O

As O
noted O
in O
our O
previous O
blog O
on O
Buhtrap B-Organization
, I-Organization
this O
gang O
has O
been O
actively O
targeting O
Russian O
businesses O
, O
mostly O
through O
spear-phishing O
. O

It O
is O
thus O
interesting O
to O
see O
Buhtrap B-Malware
add O
strategic O
web O
compromises O
to O
their O
arsenal O
. O

The O
first O
malware O
we O
saw O
was O
the O
lurk O
downloader O
, O
which O
was O
distributed O
on O
October O
26th O
. O

The O
executable O
would O
install O
the O
real O
Ammyy B-Malware
product O
, O
but O
would O
also O
launch O
a O
file O
called O
either O
AmmyyService.exe B-Indicator
or O
AmmyySvc.exe B-Indicator
which O
contained O
the O
malicious O
payload O
. O

Buhtrap B-Malware
is O
getting O
better O
at O
disguising O
the O
code O
they O
inject O
into O
compromised O
websites O
. O

With O
the O
recent O
arrests O
of O
actors O
using O
the O
Lurk B-Malware
banking O
trojan O
, O
Buhtrap B-Malware
appears O
to O
be O
a O
likely O
alternative O
for O
actors O
wishing O
to O
target O
Russian O
banks O
and O
software O
. O

They O
have O
different O
functions O
and O
ways O
of O
spreading O
, O
but O
the O
same O
purpose O
— O
to O
steal O
money O
from O
the O
accounts O
of O
businesses O
. O

Our O
experts O
have O
found O
that O
cybercriminals O
are O
actively O
focusing O
on O
SMBs O
, O
and O
giving O
particular O
attention O
to O
accountants O
. O

The O
first O
encounter O
with O
Buhtrap B-Malware
was O
registered O
back O
in O
2014 O
. O

For O
now O
, O
we O
can O
call O
RTM B-Malware
one O
of O
the O
most O
active O
financial O
Trojans O
. O

At O
that O
time O
it O
was O
the O
name O
of O
a O
cybercriminal O
group O
that O
was O
stealing O
money O
from O
Russian O
financial O
establishments O
— O
to O
the O
tune O
of O
at O
least O
$150,000 O
per O
hit O
. O

Buhtrap B-Malware
resurfaced O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
2017 O
in O
the O
TwoBee B-Malware
campaign O
, O
where O
it O
served O
primarily O
as O
means O
of O
malware O
delivery O
. O

After O
the O
source O
codes O
of O
their O
tools O
became O
public O
in O
2016 O
, O
the O
name O
Buhtrap B-Malware
was O
used O
for O
the O
financial O
Trojan O
. O

Just O
like O
last O
time O
, O
Buhtrap B-Malware
is O
spreading O
through O
exploits O
embedded O
in O
news O
outlets O
. O

Estimating O
the O
damages O
is O
challenging O
, O
but O
as O
we O
learned O
, O
the O
criminals O
are O
siphoning O
off O
assets O
in O
transactions O
that O
do O
not O
exceed O
$15,000 O
each O
. O

As O
explained O
later O
, O
we O
believe O
this O
campaign O
is O
financially-motivated O
and O
that O
it O
targets O
accounting O
departments O
in O
Russian O
businesses O
. O

" O
Buhgalter O
" O
means O
" O
accountant O
" O
in O
Russian O
. O

Seeing O
a O
campaign O
like O
this O
, O
inevitably O
the O
Anunak/Carbanak B-Malware
documented O
by O
Fox-IT B-Organization
and O
Kaspersky B-Organization
comes O
to O
mind O
. O

The O
infection O
vector O
is O
similar O
, O
it O
uses O
a O
similar O
modified O
mimikatz O
application O
, O
and O
it O
uses O
a O
third-party O
remote O
access O
tool O
, O
changes O
system O
settings O
to O
allow O
concurrent O
RDP O

, O
and O
so O

words O
, O
the O

attracted O
our O
attention O
by O

. O

We O
initially O
became O
aware O
of O

we O
observed O

this O
is O
relatively O

primarily O

to O

that O
are O

A O
Clever B-Malware
Kitten I-Malware
attack O
starts O
with O
the O
use O
of O
a O

The O

was O
identified O
as O
the O

is O
a O

that O

will O
attempt O
to O
upload O
a O
PHP O
backdoor O
to O
gain O
remote O
access O
to O
the O

. O

The O
reason O
for O
this O
is O
likely O
the O
availability O
of O

against O

, O
which O
for O
a O

of O

The O
first O
of O
which O
we O
call O
' O

At O
first O
glance O
CONFUCIUS_B B-Malware
looks O
very O
similar O

they O
are O

We O
also O
believe O
that O

after O

it O

since O
February O

The O
malicious O
samples O
we O
found O
are O
the O
early O

Perhaps O
it O
also O
points O
to O
the O

origin O
of O

The O
attacker O
is O
from O

In O
this O

we O
look O
at O
the O
Winnti B-Malware
malware O

used O
by O
two O
known O

groups O
BARIUM B-Malware
and O

. O

According O
to O
the O
German O
press O
, O
the O
intruders O
used O
the O
Winnti B-Malware
family O
of O
malware O
as O
their O
main O
implant O
, O
giving O
them O
persistent O
access O
to O
the O
conglomerate O

as O
early O
as O
February O
2016 O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
this O
malware O
, O
the O
activity O
groups O
strongly O
associated O
with O
Winnti B-Malware
are O
BARIUM B-Malware

the O
BARIUM O

To O
show O
how O

and O
how O
it O
provides O
extensive O

intelligence O
about O
these O

BARIUM B-Malware
begins O
its O

with O
potential O
victims—particularly O
those O
working O
in O
Business O
Development O
or O
Human O
Resources—on O
various O
social O

platforms O
. O

During O
these O

, O
LEAD O

was O
to O
steal O

When O

in O
2011 O
, O
it O
was O
a O
nameless O

This O

is O
an O
attempt O
to O
share O
this O
experience O
with O
other O
experts O
, O
particularly O
the O
IT O

specialists O
in O
companies O
and O
financial O
institutions O
that O
increasingly O
find O
themselves O
the O
targets O
of O
cyber-attacks O
. O

In O
most O
cases O
, O
the O
attackers O
only O
had O
to O
infect O
the O
computer O
on O
which O
the O
RBS B-Malware
software O
was O
installed O
in O
order O
to O
start O
stealing O
the O
cash O
. O

We O
were O
soon O
able O
to O
help O
investigate O
another O
incident O
involving O
Lurk B-Malware
. I-Malware

This O
event O
significantly O
affected O
the O
Russian O
cybercriminal O
world O
as O
the O
gang O
had O
stolen O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
rubles O
during O
a O
few O
years O
of O
activity O
, O
and O
was O
considered O
a O
" O
leader O
" O
among O
cybercriminals O
. O

In O
Russia O
, O
there O
were O
several O
relatively O
large O
cybercriminal O
groups O
engaged O
in O
financial O
theft O
via O
attacks O
on O
RBS B-Organization
. I-Organization

In O
April O
2013 O
, O
a O
year O
after O
we O
found O
the O
" O
bodiless O
" O
Lurk B-Malware
module O
, O
the O
Russian O
cybercriminal O
underground O
exploited O
several O
families O
of O
malicious O
software O
that O
specialized O
in O
attacks O
on O
banking O
software O
. O

Through O
the O
information O
exchanges O
used O
by O
people O
in O
the O
security O
industry O
, O
we O
learned O
that O
several O
Russian O
banks O
were O
struggling O
with O
malicious O
programs O
created O
specifically O
to O
attack O
a O
particular O
type O
of O
legal O
banking O
software O
. O

If O
it O
did O
, O
the O
malware O
downloaded O
additional O
modules O
, O
including O
ones O
allowing O
for O
the O
automatic O
creation O
of O
unauthorized O

, O
changing O

in O
legal O

orders O
, O
etc O
. O

As O
far O
as O
we O
can O
judge O
from O
the O
data O
we O
have O
, O
in O
2014 O
the O
criminal O
group O
behind O
Lurk B-Malware
seriously O
reduced O
its O

and O
" O

from O

we O
have O

This O

in O
a O
2013 O

These O

We O
believe O
the O
2013 O
, O
2015 O
, O
and O
2016 O
KeyBoy B-Malware

provide O
evidence O
of O

Chances O
are O
about O
even O
, O
though O

that O

a O
relevant O
threat O
actor O
to O
any O

about O
a O
threat O
actor O
that O
it O
follows O

called O
Mofang B-Malware

The O
name O
Mofang O
is O
based O
on O
the O
Mandarin O
verb O

which O
means O
to O

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
that O
the O
Mofang B-Organization
group O
is O
a O
group O
that O
operates O
out O
of O
China O
and O
is O
probably O
government-affiliated O

on O
the O

are O
merely O
their O
latest O
attack O
wave O
. O

The O
goal O
of O
the O

appears O
to O
be O
to O
collect O
intellectual O
property O
such O
as O
design O
documents O
, O

, O
and O

The O
attack O

started O
in O
late O
July O

and O
continued O
into O
midSeptember O
2011 O
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
the O
attacks O
appears O
to O
be O
industrial O
espionage O
, O
collecting O
intellectual O
property O
for O
competitive O
advantage O
. O

They O
then O
moved O
on O
to O
the O
motor O
industry O
in O
late O
May O
. O

From O
late O
April O
to O
early O
May O
, O
the O

focused O
on O

Attackers O
then O
moved O
on O
to O
the O

in O
late O

. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
current O
attack O

against O

began O
. O

The O

first O
researched O
desired O

then O
sent O
an O
email O

to O
the O
target O
. O

First O
, O
when O
a O
specific O
recipient O
was O
targeted O
, O
the O
mails O
often O
purported O
to O
be O
meeting O
invitations O
from O
established O
business O
partners O
. O

While O
the O
attackers O
used O
different O
pretexts O
when O
sending O
these O
malicious O
emails O
, O
two O
methodologies O
stood O
out O
. O

Secondly O
, O
when O
the O

were O
being O
sent O
to O
a O
broad O
set O
of O
recipients O
, O
the O
mails O
purported O
to O
be O
a O
necessary O
security O

. O

The O
attacks O
were O
traced O

a O

system O
that O
was O
a O
virtual O
private O

( O

Operation B-Malware
Ghoul I-Malware

be O
extra O
cautious O
while O
checking O

opening O

. O

The O
main O
point O
that O
sets O
Operation B-Malware
Groundbait I-Malware
apart O
from O
the O
other O
attacks O
is O
that O
it O
has O
mostly O
been O
targeting O
anti-government O
separatists O
in O
the O
self-declared O
Donetsk O
and O
Luhansk O
People's O
Republics O
. O

The O
attacks O
appear O
to O
be O
geopolitically O
motivated O
and O
target O
high O
profile O
organizations O
. O

The O
objective O
of O
the O
attacks O
is O
clearly O
espionage O
– O
they O
involve O
gaining O
access O
to O
top O
legislative O
, O
executive O
and O
judicial O
bodies O
around O
the O
world O
. O

The O
attackers O
have O
targeted O
a O
large O
number O
of O
organizations O
globally O
since O
early O
2017 O
, O
with O
the O
main O
focus O
on O
the O
Middle O
East O
and O
North O
Africa O
( O
MENA O
) O
, O
especially O
Palestine O
. O

The O
attacks O
were O
initially O
discovered O
while O
investigating O
a O
phishing O
attack O
that O
targeted O
political O
figures O
in O
the O
MENA O

number O
of O
other O
CIS O

The O
main O
reason O
for O
the O
increase O

were O

In O
September O
2017 O
, O
we O
discovered O
Silence B-Malware
attack O
on O
financial O
institutions O
. O

The O
infection O
vector O
is O
a O
spear-phishing O
email O
with O
a O
malicious O
attachment O
. O

An O
interesting O
point O
in O
the O
Silence B-Malware
attack O
is O
that O
the O
cybercriminals O
had O
already O
compromised O
banking O
infrastructure O
in O
order O
to O
send O
their O
spear-phishing O
emails O
from O
the O
addresses O
of O
real O
bank O
employees O
and O
look O
as O
unsuspicious O
as O
possible O
to O
future O
victims O
. O

The O
spear-phishing O
infection O
vector O
is O
still O
the O
most O
popular O
way O
to O
initiate O
targeted O
campaigns O
. O

We O
conclude O
that O
the O
actor O
behind O
the O
attack O
is O
Silence B-Organization
group I-Organization
, I-Organization
a O
relatively O
new O
threat O
actor O
that's O
been O
operating O
since O
mid-2016 O

A O
preliminary O
analysis O
caught O
the O
attention O
of O
our O
Threat O
Analysis O
and O
Intelligence O
team O
as O
it O
yielded O
interesting O
data O
that O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
shows O
that O
Silence B-Malware
was O
targeting O
employees O
from O
financial O
entities O
, O
specifically O
in O
the O
Russian O
Federation O
and O
the O
Republic O
of O
Belarus O
. O

As O
shown O
above O
, O
the O
threat O
runs O
several O
native O

to O
collect O
useful O
information O
for O
its O
recon O
phase O
. O

The O
intelligence O
we O
have O
collected O
shows O
that O
Silence B-Malware
is O
part O
of O
a O
more O
extensive O
operation O
, O
still O
focused O
on O
financial O
institutions O
operating O
mainly O
on O
Russian O
territory O
. O

These O
spearphishing O
attempts O
represent O
an O
evolution O
of O
Iranian O
actors O
based O
on O
their O
social O
engineering O
tactics O
and O
narrow O
targeting O
. O

Based O
on O
file O
modification O
dates O
and O
timestamps O
of O
samples O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
observed O
campaign O
was O
initiated O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
February O
2016 O
, O
with O
the O
infrastructure O
taken O
offline O
at O
the O
start O
of O
March O
. O

While O
the O
Sima B-Malware
moniker O
could O
similarly O
originate O
from O
software O
labels O
, O
it O
is O
a O
common O
female O
Persian O
name O
and O
a O
Persian-language O
word O
for O

Given O
its O
use O
in O
more O
advanced O
social O

campaigns O
against O
women O

rights O
activists O
, O
the O
label O
seem O
particularly O
apt O
. O

Samples O

contained O
the O

several O

within O

of O
the O

The O

All O
the O

to O
be O

been O
compiled O
between O
February O
29 O
and O
March O
1 O
2016 O

shortly O

be O
fresh O

These O
archives O
provide O
further O
indication O
that O
those O
entities O
behind O
the O
campaigns O
are O
Persian-language O
speakers O
, O
due O
to O
the O
naming O
of O

in O

. O

For O
the O
sake O
of O
narrative O
we O
are O
going O
to O
focus O
exclusively O
to O
those O

we O
identified O

A O

of O
this O

was O
uncovered O
by O
Talos B-Organization
in O
June O
2017 O
, O
and O
since O
then O
very O
little O
of O
this O

seen O
in O

After O
reviewing O
all O
the O
malware O
functionalities O
, O
we O
are O
confident O
in O
saying O
that O
the O
attackers O
look O
for O
victims O
who O
answer O
well-defined O
characteristics O
and O
believe O
that O
further O
stages O
of O
the O

are O
delivered O
only O
to O
those O
who O
fit O
the O
specific O
victim O

In O
this O

however O
, O
the O

But O
, O
thanks O
to O
the O
attackers O
known O
affection O
for O
decoy O

that O
pose O

, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
date O
the O
campaign O
back O
to O
March O
2018 O
. O

With O
the O
experience O
gained O
from O
the O
APT B-System
attack O
that O
began O
in O
March O
2017 O
, O
it O
seems O
this O
campaign O
has O
evolved O
into O
an O
attack O
with O
new O
capabilities O
, O
and O
an O
even O
more O
specific O

, O
over O
a O

These O
unknown O

continued O
launching O

over O
the O

years O

For O
simplicity O
, O
Kaspersky B-Organization
is O
calling O
them O
the O
BlackEnergy B-Organization
APT I-Organization
group O
. O

Since O
the O
middle O
of O

, O
one O
of O
the O

BlackEnergy B-Organization
is O
a O
highly O
dynamic O
threat O
actor O
and O
the O
current O
attacks O
in O

indicate O
that O
destructive O
actions O
are O
on O
their O

agenda O
, O
in O

to O

Kaspersky B-Organization
will O
continue O
to O
monitor O
the O
BlackEnergy B-Malware

in O

and O
update O
our O

with O

when O

From O
Buhtrap B-Malware
perpetrating O

its O

has O
been O
expanded O

conduct O

Throughout O

we've O

this O

deploy O
its O
main O
backdoor O
as O
well O
as O
other O
tools O
against O
various O
victims O
, O
but O
June O
2019 O
was O
the O
first O
time O
we O
saw O
the O
Buhtrap B-Malware
group O
use O
a O
zero-day B-Vulnerability
exploit I-Vulnerability
as O
part O
of O
a O

In O
that O

However O
, O
as O
the O
shift O
in O

occurred O
before O
the O

, O
we O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
the O

people O
behind O

malware O
attacks O
against O
businesses O

are O
also O

When O

was O
targeting O

, O
the O
decoy O

would O
typically O
be O

When O

The O

of O
being O
highly O

threat O
actors O
typically O
stop O

their O

their O

The O
threat O
actors O
behind O
the O
Sea B-Malware

campaign O
were O
successful O
in O
compromising O

falsifying O

Cisco B-Organization

recently O
published O

describing O

in O
the O
Middle O

which O
we O
believe O
may O
be O
connected O

Operation O

appears O
to O
be O
another O
symptom O
of O
escalating O
tensions O
in O
the O
Middle O

. O

The O
attackers O
have O
taken O
great O
care O
to O
stay O
under O
the O
radar O
, O
imitating O
another O
attack O
group O
in O
the O
region O
. O

With O
deception O
and O
false O
flags O
increasingly O
being O
employed O
by O
threat O
actors O
, O
attribution O
is O
a O
hard O
and O
complicated O
task O
that O
requires O
solid O
evidence O
, O
especially O
in O
complex O
regions O
such O
as O
the O
Middle O
East O
. O

The O
malware O
was O
first O
seen O
packed O
with O
VMProtect; B-Malware
when O
unpacked O
the O
sample O
didn’t O
show O
any O
similarities O
with O
previously O
known O
malware O
. O

The O
malware O
starts O
communicating O
with O
the O
C&C O
server O
by O
sending O
basic O
information O
about O
the O
infected O
machine O
. O

The O
malware O
basically O
provides O
a O
remote O
CMD/PowerShell B-System
terminal O
for O
the O
attackers O
, O
enabling O
them O
to O
execute O
scripts/commands O
and O
receive O
the O
results O
via O
HTTP O
requests O
. O

What O
lied O
beneath O
this O
facade O
was O
a O
well-engineered O
campaign O
of O
phishing O
attacks O
designed O
to O
steal O
credentials O
and O
spy O
on O
the O
activity O
of O
dozens O
of O
journalists O
, O
human O
rights O
defenders O
, O
trade O

and O

activists O
, O
many O
of O
whom O
are O
seemingly O
involved O
in O
the O
issue O
of O
migrants’ O
rights O
in O
Qatar O
and O
Nepal O
. O

We O

this O

, I-Malware

. I-Malware

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
in O
December O
2016 O
, O
Amnesty B-Organization
International I-Organization
published O
an O
investigation O
into O
another O
social O
engineering O
campaign O
perpetrated O
by O
a O
seemingly O
fake O
human O

organization O
known O
as O

which O
targeted O
international O
human O
rights O
and O
labour O
rights O
organizations O
campaigning O
on O
migrant O

rights O
in O
Qatar O
. O

It O
appears O
that O
the O
attackers O
may O
have O
impersonated O
the O
identity O
of O
a O
real O
young O
woman O
and O
stole O
her O
pictures O
to O
construct O
the O
fake O
profile O
, O
along O
with O
a O
professional O

also O
stolen O
from O

In O
the O
course O
of O
this O

, O
the O
attacker O
— O

then O
sent O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
invitations O
to O
access O
several O
documents O
on O

The O
attackers O
were O
meticulous O
in O
making O
their O

it O

Operation O
Pawn B-Malware
Storm I-Malware
is O
an O
active O
economic O

We O
believe O
the O
iOS B-System

gets O
installed O
on O
already O
compromised O

, O
and O
it O
is O
very O
similar O

Assuming O
this O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak B-Malware
has O
been O
observed O
in O
the O
wild O
, O
there O
are O
a O
number O
of O

The O
earliest O
step O
in O
any O
possible O
attack(s) O
involving O
this O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak B-Malware
of O
which O
Proofpoint B-Organization
researchers O
are O
currently O
aware O
begin O
with O
the O
MSIL B-Malware
dropper O
. O

The O
basic O
chain O
of O
events O
upon O
execution O
of O
the O
MSIL O
dropper O
include O
dropping O
and O
executing O
both O
a O
PDF O
decoy O
and O
a O
Javascript O
(JS) O
dropper O
. O

As O
explained O
in O
further O
detail O
below O
, O
the O
JS O
dropper O
ultimately O
installs O
a O
JS O
decryptor O
onto O
an O
infected O
machine O
that O
will O
then O
finally O
decrypt O
and O
execute O
the O
actual O
KopiLuwak B-Malware
backdoor O
in O
memory O
only O
. O

As O
Proofpoint B-Organization
has O
not O
yet O
observed O
this O
attack O
in O
the O
wild O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
there O
is O
an O
additional O
component O
that O
leads O
to O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
MSIL O
payload O
. O

The O
newer O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak B-Malware
is O
now O
capable O
of O
exfiltrating O
files O
to O
the O
C&C O
as O
well O
as O
downloading O
files O
and O
saving O
them O
to O
the O
infected O
machine O
. O

Despite O
the O
added O
capabilities O
, O
we O
still O
agree O
with O
Kaspersky B-Organization
that O
this O
backdoor O
is O
likely O
used O
as O
an O
initial O
reconnaissance O
tool O
and O
would O
probably O
be O
used O
as O
a O
staging O
point O
to O
deploy O
one O
of O
Turla’s B-Malware
more O
fully O
featured O

The O
role O
of O
the O

Moreover O
, O
Turla B-Malware
now O
also O
has O
a O
heavily O

The O
PowerShell B-System
version O
of O
the O
Trojan O
also O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
get O

The O
Trojan O
is O
quite O
similar O
to O

We O
believe O
these O
operations O
include O
broadly O
malicious O
activity O
that O
can O
enable O
further O
operations O
, O
such O
as O
targeting O

, O
while O
other O
activities O
are O
explicitly O
financially O
motivated O
, O
such O
as O
abusing O
in-game O
currency O
mechanics O
. O

In O
October O
2012 O
, O
APT41 B-Malware
used O
captured O
credentials O
to O
compromise O
a O
jump O
server O
and O
access O
a O
production O
environment O
where O
they O
deployed O
a O
Linux B-System
version O
of O
PHOTO B-System
. I-System

Since O
at O
least O
2012 O
, O
APT41 B-Malware
has O
repeatedly O
gained O
access O
to O
game O
development O
environments O
within O
affected O
companies O
, O
including O
online O
multiplayer O
networks O
, O
as O
well O
as O
targeting O
of O
production O
database O

. O

APT41 B-Malware
has O
been O
observed O
inserting O
malicious O
code O
into O
legitimate O
video O
game O
files O
to O
distribute O
malware O
. O

In O
2018 O
, O
the O
group O
inserted O
CRACKSHOT B-Malware
malware O
into O
game O
files O
that O
were O
signed O
with O
legitimate O
codesigning O
certificates O
, O
most O
likely O
indicating O
access O
to O
the O
production O
environment O
, O
which O
facilitated O
a O
supply O
chain O
compromise O
. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
APT41 B-Malware
limitedly O
deploy O
rootkits O
on O
Linux B-System
systems O
and O
Master B-System

Record I-System
(MBR) I-System
bootkits O
, O
such O
as O
ROCKBOOT B-Malware
, I-Malware
on O

to O
hide O
their O
malware O
and O
maintain O
persistence O
on O
victim O

. O

Selective O
deployment O
of O
ROCKBOOT B-Malware
suggests O
that O
APT41 B-Malware
reserves O
more O
advanced O
TTPs O
and O
malware O
only O
for O
high-value O
targets O
. O

APT41 B-Malware
has O
blatantly O
engaged O
in O
financially O
motivated O
activity O
targeting O
the O
video O
game O
industry O
, O
including O
manipulating O
virtual O
currencies O
. O

In O
a O
highly O
unusual O
case O
, O
APT41 B-Malware
attempted O
to O
extort O
a O
game O
company O
by O
deploying O
the O
Encryptor B-Malware
RaaS I-Malware
ransomware O
. O

APT41 B-Malware
is O
well-known O
for O
leveraging O
compromised O
digital O
certificates O
from O
video O
game O
studios O
to O
sign O
malware O
. O

We O
suggest O
that O
APT41 B-Malware
sought O
to O
target O
in-game O
currency O
but O
found O
they O
could O
not O
monetize O
the O
specific O
targeted O
game O
, O
so O
the O
group O
resorted O
to O
ransomware O
to O
attempt O
to O
salvage O
their O
efforts O
and O
profit O
from O
the O
compromise O
. O

APT41 B-Malware
has O
also O
used O
credentials O
compromised O
in O
previous O
operations O
. O

In O
2014 O
, O
APT41 B-Malware
compromised O
an O

using O
VPN O
access O
between O
a O

Explicit O
financially-motivated O

is O
unusual O
among O
Chinese O

groups O
, O
and O
evidence O
suggests O
APT41 B-Malware
has O
conducted O
simultaneous O
cyber O
crime O
and O
cyber O
espionage O
operations O
from O
2014 O
onward O
. O

APT41 B-Malware
operations O
against O
higher O
education O
, O
travel O
services O
, O
and O
news/media O
firms O
provide O
some O
indication O
that O
the O
group O
also O
tracks O
individuals O
and O
conducts O
surveillance O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
group O
has O
repeatedly O
targeted O
call O
record O
information O
at O
telecom O
companies O
. O

APT41 B-Organization
has O
established O
and O
maintained O
strategic O
access O
to O
organizations O
in O
the O
healthcare O
, O
high-tech O
, O
and O
telecommunications O
sectors O
. O

The O
group’s O
financially O
motivated O
activity O
has O
primarily O
focused O
on O
the O
video O
game O
industry O
, O
where O
APT41 B-Malware
has O
manipulated O
virtual O
currencies O
and O
even O
attempted O
to O
deploy O
ransomware O
. O

In O
another O
instance O
, O
APT41 B-Malware
targeted O
a O
hotel’s O
reservation O
systems O
ahead O
of O
Chinese O
officials O
staying O
there O
, O
suggesting O
the O
group O
was O
tasked O
to O
reconnoiter O
the O

reasons O
. O

These O
supply O

have O
also O
been O
characteristic O
of O
APT41’s B-Malware
best O
known O
and O
most O
recent O
espionage O
campaigns O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
despite O
the O
significant O
effort O
required O
to O
execute O
supply O
chain O
compromises O
and O
the O
large O
number O
of O
affected O
organizations O
, O
APT41 B-Malware
limits O
the O
deployment O
of O
follow-on O
malware O
to O
specific O
victim O
systems O
by O
matching O
against O
individual O
system O
identifiers O
. O

Mapping O
the O
group’s O
activities O
since O
2012 O
(Figure O
2) O
also O
provides O
some O
indication O
that O
APT41 B-Malware
primarily O
conducts O
financially O
motivated O
operations O
outside O
of O
their O
normal O
day O
jobs O
. O

The O
latter O
is O
especially O
notable O
because O
APT41 B-Malware
has O
repeatedly O
returned O
to O
targeting O
the O
video O
game O
industry O
and O
we O
believe O
these O
activities O
were O
formative O
in O
the O
group’s O
later O
espionage O
operations O
. O

APT41 B-Malware
leverages O
an O
arsenal O
of O
over O
46 O
different O

and O
tools O
unique O
to O
the O

. O

Once O
in O
a O
victim O
organization O
, O
APT41 B-Malware
can O
leverage O
more O
sophisticated O
TTPs O
and O
deploy O
additional O
malware O
. O

APT41 B-Malware
often O
relies O
on O
spear-phishing O
emails O
with O
attachments O
such O
as O
compiled O
HTML O

to O
initially O
compromise O
their O

on O
a O
limited O
basis O
to O

The O
limited O

Based O
on O
the O

we O
believe O
the O

Lastly O
, O
we O

However O
, O
using O

we O
were O
able O
to O
discover O

The O

we O
do O
not O
have O
access O

so O
we O

following O
some O

By O
March O
2016 O
, O
one O
of O

had O
built O
enough O
trust O
with O
a O

we’ll O
call O

she O
became O
a O
frequent O

for O
the O

Alpha’s B-Malware
early O
role O
was O
fairly O
simple: O
engage O
with O
individuals O
, O
who O
he O
chose O
based O
on O
the O
goods O
they O
were O
selling O

By O
all O

late O
2015 O
was O
the O

The O
first O
type O
of O

Scattered B-Malware

pivoted O
to O
was O
credential O

. O

Between O
July O
2015 O
and O
February O
2016 O
, O
Scattered B-Malware
Canary’s I-Malware
primary O
focus O
seemed O
to O
be O
mass O
harvesting O
general O

using O
a O
Google B-System

. O

In O
the O
first O
few O
months O
of O
their O

, O
Scattered B-Malware
Canary’s I-Malware
sights O
were O
mostly O
set O
on O
Asian O
targets—Malaysia O
and O
Japan O
, O
in O
particular O
. O

In O
November O
2015 O
, O
the O
group O
started O
to O
focus O
on O
North O
American O

, O
mostly O
in O
the O
United O
States O
. O

This O
activity O
ceased O
in O
February O
2016 O
, O
likely O
because O
the O
men O
who O
made O
up O
Scattered B-Malware

began O
to O
focus O
on O
honing O
their O

skills. O
In O

In O
July O
2018 O

following O
a O
trend O
we O
have O
observed O
across O
the O
entire O
BEC B-System

Scattered B-Malware
Canary I-Malware
changed O
their O
preferred O

Using O

against O
US O

In O
total O

35 O
actors O
have O
been O
tied O
to O

Canary’s I-Malware
operations O
since O
the O

Just O
as O
with O

copy-and-paste O

When O
it O
comes O

the O
existence O
of O

called O

which O
we O
attribute O
to O
the O
Sednit B-Malware

If O
Scattered B-Malware
Canary I-Malware
can O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
microcosm O
for O
the O
rapidly O
evolving O
organizations O
behind O
today’s O
most O
pernicious O
email O
scams O
, O
this O
report O
demonstrates O
that O
a O
much O
more O
holistic O
approach—one O
based O
on O
threat O
actor O
identity O
rather O
than O
type O
of O
fraudulent O
activity—is O
required O
to O
detect O
email O
fraud O
and O
protect O
organizations O
. O

This O
is O
a O
first O
for O
an O
APT B-Organization
group O

shows O
Sednit B-Organization
has O
access O
to O
very O
sophisticated O
tools O
to O
conduct O
its O
espionage O
operations O
. O

Three O
years O

In O
the O

, O
Sednit B-Organization

. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
August O
2018 O
, O
the O
Sednit B-Organization

launched O
a O
spearphishing O

where O
it O
distributed O

that O
delivered O
the O
first O

that O

Turla B-Malware
PowerShell B-System
loader O
that O
was O
based O
on O
the O
open-source O
project O
Posh-SecMod B-System
. I-System

Turla B-Malware
is O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
operating O
since O
at O
least O
2008 O
, O
when O
it O
successfully O
breached O
the O
US O

. O

This O
is O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Turla B-Organization
has O
used O

to O
increase O
its O
chances O
of O

However O
, O
it O
is O
likely O
the O

more O
globally O
against O

In O

It O
is O
interesting O
to O
note O
that O

This O

confirms O
our O

and O
shows O
that O
the O
Turla B-Organization
group O
does O
not O
hesitate O
to O
use O

to O
conduct O

during O

been O
using O

early O

, O
in O

, O

which O
was O
encoded O
and O
given O
a O

in O

. O

In O
all O
likelihood O
, O
Waterbug’s B-Malware
use O
of O
Crambus B-System
infrastructure O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
a O
hostile O
takeover O
. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
interesting O
things O
to O
occur O
during O
one O
of O
Waterbug’s B-Malware
recent O
campaigns O
was O
that O
during O
an O
attack O
against O
one O
target O
in O
the O
Middle O
East O
, O
Waterbug B-Malware
appeared O
to O
hijack O
infrastructure O
from O
the O
Crambus B-Organization
espionage O
group O
and O
used O
it O
to O
deliver O
malware O
on O
to O
the O
victim’s O
network O
. O

These O
three O
recent O
Waterbug B-Malware
campaigns O
have O
seen O
the O
group O
compromise O
governments O
and O
international O
organizations O
across O
the O
globe O
in O
addition O
to O
targets O
in O
the O
IT O
and O
education O
sectors O
. O

Curiously O
though O
, O
Waterbug B-Malware
also O
compromised O
other O
computers O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
using O
its O
own O
infrastructure O
. O

Symantec B-Organization
believes O
that O
the O
variant O
of O
Mimikatz B-Malware
used O
in O
this O
attack O
is O
unique O
to O
Waterbug B-Malware
. I-Malware

Aside O
from O
the O
attack O
involving O
Crambus B-System
infrastructure O
, O
this O
sample O
of O
Mimikatz B-Malware
has O
only O
been O
seen O
used O
in O
one O
other O
attack O
, O
against O
an O
education O
target O
in O
the O
UK O
in O
2017 O
. O

The O
first O
observed O
evidence O
of O
Waterbug B-Malware
activity O
came O
on O
January O
11 O
, O
2018 O
, O
when O
a O
Waterbug-linked B-Malware

(a O

scheduler O
named O
msfgi.exe) B-Indicator
was O
dropped O
on O
to O
a O
computer O
on O
the O

network O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
attack O
against O
the O
Middle O
Eastern O
target O
, O
Crambus B-Malware
was O
the O
first O
group O
to O
compromise O
the O
victim’s O
network O
, O
with O
the O
earliest O
evidence O
of O
activity O
dating O
to O
November O
2017 O
. O

Waterbug’s B-Malware
intrusions O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
continued O
for O
much O
of O

. O

Symantec B-Organization

observed O
activity O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
and O
its O
observed O
use O
of O
Crambus B-System
infrastructure O
suggests O
that O
Waterbug B-Organization
may O
have O
used O
the O
Crambus B-System
infrastructure O
as O
an O
initial O
access O
point. O
It O
also O
reconfigures O
the O
Microsoft B-System
Sysinternals I-System
registry O
to O
prevent O
pop-ups O
when O
running O
the O
PsExec B-System

Waterbug B-System
also O
used O
an O
older O
version O

, I-System
likely O
to O
avoid O

. O

In O
one O
of O

a O

renown O
for O
attempting O
to O

and O
their O
brazen O
use O
of O
destructive O
malware O
. O

Based O
on O
observed O
activity O
, O
we O
judge O
that O
APT38 B-Malware
's I-Malware
primary O
mission O
is O
targeting O
financial O
institutions O
and O
manipulating O
inter-bank O
financial O
systems O
to O
raise O
large O
sums O
of O

for O
the O

APT38 B-Malware
, I-Malware
in O

, O
is O
strongly O
distinguishable O
because O
of O
its O
specific O
focus O
on O

that O
attempt O
to O
use O
SWIFT B-System

to O
steal O

As O

, O
we O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
APT38 B-Malware
's I-Malware
mission O
is O
focused O
on O

to O
raise O

assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
the O

The O

The O

is O
a O

Like O
many O

much O
of O
APT40 B-Malware

activity O
begins O
by O
attempting O
to O
trick O
targets O
with O

, O
before O
deploying O

such O
as O
the O
Gh0st B-Malware

. O

We O
suspect O
that O
the O

sought O
access O

to O
obtain O
information O
that O
would O
enable O

although O
the O
quality O
of O

varied O

One O
curious O
trait O
of O
Bahamut B-Organization
is O
that O
it O
develops O
fully-functional O

activities O
, O
rather O
than O
push O
nonfunctional O

Curiously O
, O
Bahamut B-Malware

track O

to O

to O

Thus O
far O
, O
Bahamut B-Malware

appeared O
to O
be O
primarily O
espionage O

If O

was O
a O
well-engineered O

It O
appears O
that O
the O

may O
have O
impersonated O

We O

that O

moved O
toward O
strategic O

In O

as O
a O

. O

We O
suggest O
that O
APT41 B-Malware
sought O
to O
target O
in-game O
currency O
but O
found O
they O
could O
not O
monetize O
the O

so O
the O

resorted O
