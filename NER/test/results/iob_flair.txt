The O

use O
two O

are O

these O

began O
with O

not O
observed O

Based O
on O
this O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
Rancor B-ORG

were O
targeting O

Additionally O
, O
these O

The O

That O
this O

apparent O
from O

the O

, O
they O

In O

we O

In O
this O
blog O
we O
provide O
insight O
into O
the O
tactics O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
(TTPs) O
of O
a O
Brazilian B-MISC
cyber O
crime O
group O
that O
specializes O
in O
payment O
card O
fraud O
operations O
. O

The O
threat O
actors O
, O
observed O
by O
FireEye B-ORG
Labs I-ORG
, I-ORG
use O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise O
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
, O
including O
sharing O
or O
purchasing O
dumps O
online O
, O
hacking O
vulnerable O
merchant O
websites O
and O
compromising O
payment O
card O
processing O
devices O
. O

Once O
in O
their O
possession O
, O
the O
actors O
use O
these O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
to O
generate O
further O
card O
information O
. O

The O
members O
of O
the O
group O
use O
a O
variety O
of O
tools O
, O
including O
CCleaner B-MISC
, I-MISC
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
to O
effectively O
remove O
any O
evidence O
of O
their O
operations O
. O

Another O
common O
step O
taken O
by O
threat O
actors O
is O
changing O
their O
system's O
MAC B-ORG
Address I-ORG
to O
avoid O
being O
uniquely O
identified O
. O

For O
this O
purpose O
, O
these O
actors O
often O
use O
tools O
such O
as O
Technitium B-MISC
MAC I-MISC
Address I-MISC
Changer I-MISC
. I-MISC

We O
have O
observed O
these O
actors O
using O
Tor O
or O
proxy-based O
tools O
similar O
to O
Tor O
(e.g O
, O
UltraSurf B-MISC
, I-MISC
as O
seen O
in O
Figure O
2) O
. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
them O
using O
virtual O
private O
network O
services O
that O
use O
IPs B-MISC
based O
in O
numerous O
countries O
to O
ensure O
anonymity O
and O
obfuscate O
criminal O
operations O
. O

Based O
on O
our O
observations O
, O
this O
group O
uses O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise O
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
. O

Payment O
card O
dumps O
are O
commonly O
shared O
amongst O
Brazilian B-MISC
threat O
actors O
via O
social O
media O
forums O
such O
as O
Facebook B-ORG
, I-ORG
Skype B-ORG
, I-ORG
and O
web-based O
WhatsApp B-ORG
messenger O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
group O
takes O
advantage O
of O
freely O
available O
consolidations O
of O
email O
credentials O
, O
personal O
information O
, O
and O
other O
data O
shared O
in O
eCrime B-ORG
forums O
for O
fraud O
purposes O
. O

These O
actors O
scan O
websites O
for O
vulnerabilities O
to O
exploit O
to O
illicitly O
access O
databases O
. O

They O
most O
commonly O
target O
Brazilian B-MISC
merchants O
, O
though O
others O
use O
the O
same O
tactics O
to O
exploit O
entities O
outside O
Brazil B-LOC
. I-LOC

The O
group O
also O
uses O
the O
SQL B-MISC
injection O
(SQLi) O
tools O
Havij B-MISC
Advanced I-MISC
SQL I-MISC
Injection I-MISC
Tool I-MISC
and O
SQLi O
Dumper O
version O
7.0 O
(Figure O

to O
scan O
for O
and O
exploit O
vulnerabilities O
in O
targeted O
eCommerce O
sites O
. O

At O
least O
eight O
sellers O
update O
the O
website O
as O
frequently O
as O
daily O
, O
offering O
newly O
obtained O
databases O
from O
the O
U.S B-LOC
. I-LOC

Once O
in O
possession O
of O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
, O
these O
actors O
use O
tools O
commonly O
known O
as O
card O
generators O
to O
generate O
new O
card O
numbers O
based O
on O
the O
compromised O
ones O
, O
creating O
additional O
opportunities O
for O
monetization O
. O

One O
bulk O
card-checking O
tool O
this O
group O
uses O
is O
Testador B-MISC
Amazon.com I-MISC

(Figure O

Despite O
its O
name O
, O
this O
tool O
does O
not O
use O

exploits O
an O

France B-LOC
. I-LOC

The O
actors O
frequently O
use O
the O
stolen O
data O
to O
create O
cloned O
physical O
cards O
, O
which O
they O
use O
to O
attempt O
to O
withdraw O
funds O
from O

The O
group O
primarily O
uses O
the O
MSR B-MISC
606 I-MISC
Software I-MISC
(Figure O
12) O
and O
Hardware B-MISC
(Figure O
13) O
to O
create O
cloned O

. O

However O
, O
Brazilian B-MISC
actors O
commonly O
use O
several O
methods O
to O
do O
so O
, O
such O
as O
reselling O
cards O
they O
have O
created O
, O
paying O
bills O
with O
stolen O

in O
return O
for O
a O
portion O

Our O
analysis O
has O
led O
us O
to O
conclude O
that O

government-sponsored O
and O
one O
of O
the O
most O
persistent O
of O
China B-LOC

The O
simplest O
conclusion O
based O
on O
these O
facts O
is O
that O
APT1 B-ORG
is O
operating O
in O
China B-LOC
, I-LOC
and O
most O
likely O
in O
Shanghai B-LOC

These O
data O

show O
that O
APT1 B-ORG

either O
operating O
in O

or O
that O
APT1 B-MISC
is O
intentionally O
going O
to O

lengths O
to O
look O

are O

APT1 B-ORG

This O
neatly O
ties O
together O
many O
of O
the O
tools O
used O
by O
the O
Dukes B-ORG
group O
, O
as O
versions O
of O
this O
one O

have O
been O
used O
to O
load O
malware O
from O
three O
different O
Dukes-related B-MISC
toolsets O
CosmicDuke B-MISC
, I-MISC
PinchDuke B-ORG
, I-ORG
and O
MiniDuke B-ORG
– O
over O
the O
course O
of O
five O
years O
. O

The O
Dukes B-ORG
continued O
the O
expansion O
of O
their O
arsenal O
in O
2011 O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
two O
more O
toolsets O
: O
MiniDuke B-ORG
and O
CozyDuke B-ORG
. I-ORG

As O
we O
now O
know O
, O
by O
February O
2013 O
the O
Dukes B-ORG
group O
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke B-MISC
and O
other O
toolsets O
for O
at O
least O
4 O
and O
a O
half O
years O
. O

Secondly O
, O
the O
value O
the O
Dukes B-PER
intended O
to O
gain O
from O
these O
MiniDuke B-MISC
campaigns O
may O
have O
been O
so O
great O
that O
they O
deemed O
it O
worth O
the O
risk O
of O
getting O
noticed O
. O

This O
is O
in O
stark O
contrast O
to O
some O
other O
suspected O
Russian B-MISC
threat O
actors O
( O
such O
as O
Operation B-ORG
Pawn I-ORG
Storm I-ORG
) I-ORG
who O
appear O
to O
have O
increased O
their O
targeting O
of O
Ukraine B-LOC
following O
the O
crisis O
. O

The O
Dukes B-PER
actively O
targeted O
Ukraine B-LOC
before O
the O
crisis O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
Russia B-LOC
was O
still O
weighing O
her O
options O
, O
but O
once O
Russia B-LOC
moved O
from O
diplomacy O
to O
direct O
action O
, O
Ukraine B-LOC
was O
no O
longer O
relevant O
to O
the O
Dukes B-PER
in O
the O
same O
way O
. O

In O
the O
latter O
case O
however O
, O
the O
Dukes B-ORG
group O
appear O
to O
have O
also O
simultaneously O
developed O
an O
entirely O
new O
loader O
, O
which O
we O
first O
observed O
being O
used O
in O
conjunction O
with O
CosmicDuke B-ORG
during O
the O
spring O
of O
2015 O
. O

The O
Dukes B-PER
could O
have O
ceased O
all O
use O
of O
CosmicDuke B-ORG
( O
at O
least O
until O
they O
had O
developed O
a O
new O
loader O
) O
or O
retired O
it O
entirely O
, O
since O
they O
still O
had O
other O
toolsets O
available O
. O

For O
these O
CozyDuke B-MISC
campaigns O
however O
, O
the O
Dukes B-PER
appear O
to O
have O
employed O
two O
particular O
later-stage O
toolsets O
, O
SeaDuke B-ORG
and O
HammerDuke B-ORG
. I-ORG

Firstly O
, O
as O
with O
the O
MiniDuke B-MISC
campaigns O
of O
February O
2013 O
and O
CosmicDuke B-MISC
campaigns O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
2014 O
, O
again O
the O
group O
clearly O
prioritized O
the O
continuation O
of O
their O
operations O
over O
maintaining O
stealth O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
notably O
overt O
and O
large-scale O
campaigns O
with O
CozyDuke B-MISC
and O
CloudDuke B-MISC
, I-MISC
the O
Dukes B-PER
also O
continued O
to O
engage O
in O
more O
covert O
, O
surgical O
campaigns O
using O
CosmicDuke B-MISC
. I-MISC

We O
are O
however O
only O
aware O
of O
one O
instance O
- O
the O
exploitation O
of O
CVE-2013-0640 O
to O
deploy O
MiniDuke B-MISC
- O
where O
we O
believe O
the O
exploited O
vulnerability O
was O
a O
zero-day O
at O
the O
time O
that O
the O
group O
acquired O
the O
exploit O
. O

All O
of O
the O
available O
evidence O
however O
does O
in O
our O
opinion O
suggest O
that O
the O
group O
operates O
on O

of O

carefully O
conducting O

although O

We O
consider O
APT38 B-ORG
's I-ORG
operations O
more O
global O
and O
highly O
specialized O
for O
targeting O
the O

sector O
. O

APT38 B-ORG
is O
a O
financially O
motivated O
group O
linked O
to O
North B-MISC
Korean I-MISC
cyber O
espionage O
operators O
, O
renown O
for O
attempting O
to O
steal O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
dollars O
from O
financial O
institutions O
and O
their O
brazen O
use O
of O

. O

Because O
APT38 B-ORG
is O
backed O
by O
( O
and O
acts O
on O

of O
) O
the O
North B-MISC

we O
opted O
to O
categorize O
the O

an O
" O

" O
instead O
of O
a O
" O

Over O
time O
these O

similarities O
diverged O

as O

outcomes O

TTPs B-MISC

almost O
certainly O
indicating O
that O
TEMP.Hermit B-ORG
activity O
is O
made O
up O
of O
multiple O
operational O
groups O
primarily O
linked O
together O
with O
shared O
malware O
development O
resources O
and O
North B-MISC

state O
sponsorship O
. O

Based O
on O
observed O
activity O
, O
we O
judge O
that O
APT38 B-ORG
's I-ORG
primary O
mission O
is O
targeting O
financial O
institutions O
and O
manipulating O
inter-bank O
financial O
systems O
to O
raise O
large O
sums O
of O
money O
for O
the O
North B-MISC
Korean I-MISC
regime O
. O

Since O
2015 O
, O
APT38 B-ORG
has O
attempted O
to O
steal O
hundreds O
of O
millions O

dollars O
from O

institutions O

APT38 B-ORG
has O
pursued O
their O
main O
objective O
of O
targeting O
banks O
and O
financial O
entities O
since O
at O
least O
2014 O
. O

We O
surmise O
that O
the O
targeting O
of O
banks O
, O
media O
, O
and O
government O
agencies O
is O
conducted O
in O
support O
of O
APT38 B-ORG
's I-ORG
primary O
mission O
. O

The O
APT38 B-ORG
targeted O
news O
outlets O
known O
for O
their O
business O
and O
financial O
sector O
reporting O
, O
probably O
in O
support O
of O
efforts O
to O
identify O
and O
compromise O
additional O
financial O
institutions O
. O

APT38 B-ORG
also O
targeted O
financial O
transaction O
exchange O
companies O
likely O
because O
of O
their O
proximity O
to O
banks O
. O

Given O
the O
lapse O
in O
time O
between O
the O
spear-phishing O
and O
the O
heist O
activity O
in O
the O
above O
example O
, O
we O
suggest O
two O
separate O
but O
related O
groups O
under O
the O
North B-MISC

regime O
were O
responsible O
for O
carrying O
out O
missions O
; O
one O

APT38 B-ORG

in O

is O
strongly O
distinguishable O
because O
of O
its O
specific O
focus O
on O

that O
attempt O
to O
use O

to O

millions O
of O

at O
a O
time O
. O

We O
can O
confirm O
that O
the O
APT38 B-MISC
operator O
activity O
is O
linked O
to O
the O
North B-MISC

that O

appears O
to O
rely O

announcing O
the O
discovery O
of O
two O
new O
gangs O
engaged O
in O
APT-style B-MISC

– O
Metel B-ORG
and O

and O
the O
reemergence O
of O
the O
Carbanak B-ORG

with O

In O
2015 O
, O
Kaspersky B-ORG
Lab I-ORG
researchers O
conducted O
Incident O

for O
29 O
organizations O
located O
in O

infected O
by O
these O
three O
groups O

In O
all O
, O
Kaspersky B-ORG
Lab I-ORG
discovered O
Metel B-ORG
in O
more O
than O
30 O
financial O
institutions O
. O

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
that O
this O
threat O
is O
far O
more O
widespread O
and O
we O
urge O
financial O
institutions O
around O
the O
world O
to O
scan O
their O
networks O
for O
signs O
of O
the O
Metel B-MISC
malware O
. O

A O
second O
group O
, O
which O
we O
call O
GCMAN B-MISC
because O
the O
malware O
is O
based O
on O
code O
compiled O
on O
the O
GCC B-ORG
compiler O
, O
emerged O
recently O
using O
similar O
techniques O
to O
the O
Metel B-ORG
Group I-ORG
to O
infect O
banking O
institutions O
and O
attempt O
to O
transfer O
money O
to O
e-currency O
services O
. O

Our O
investigations O
revealed O
that O
the O
attackers O
drove O
around O
several O
cities O
in O
Russia B-LOC
, I-LOC
stealing O
money O
from O
ATMs O
belonging O
to O
different O
banks O
. O

Once O
inside O
the O
network O
, O
the O
GCMAN B-ORG
group O
uses O
legitimate O
and O
penetration O
testing O
tools O
such O
as O
Putty B-ORG
, I-ORG
VNC B-ORG
, I-ORG
and O
Meterpreter B-ORG
for O
lateral O
movement O
. O

Our O
investigation O
revealed O
an O
attack O
where O
the O
GCMAN B-ORG
group O
then O
planted O
a O
cron O
script O
into O
bank O
's O
server O
, O
sending O
financial O
transactions O
at O
the O
rate O
of O
$200 O
per O
minute O
. O

The O
GCMAN B-ORG
group O
used O
an O
MS B-MISC
SQL I-MISC
injection O
in O
commercial O
software O
running O
on O
one O
of O
bank O
's O
public O
web O
services O
, O
and O
about O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
later O
, O
they O
came O
back O
to O
cash O
out O
. O

During O
that O
time O
they O
poked O
70 O
internal O
hosts O
, O
compromised O
56 O

, O
making O
their O
way O
from O
139 O

. O

However O
, O
in O
September O
last O
year O
, O
our O
friends O
at O
CSIS B-ORG
published O
a O
blog O
detailing O
a O
new O
Carbanak B-ORG

affecting O
one O

. O

Kaspersky B-ORG

responded O
to O
three O
financial O
institutions O
in O
Russia B-LOC
that O
were O
infected O
with O
the O
GCMAN B-MISC
malware O
. O

In O
one O
remarkable O
case O
, O
the O
Carbanak B-MISC
2.0 I-MISC
gang O
used O
its O
access O
to O
a O

that O

change O
the O

However O

from O
this O
it O

only O
clear O
that O

it O
was O
not O

whether O

very O
large O

works O

on O

hitting O

because O
they O
are O
, O
apparently O
, O

To O
date O
, O
the O
Lazarus B-ORG
group O
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
most O
successful O
in O
launching O
large O
scale O
operations O
against O
the O
financial O
industry O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Lazarus B-ORG

A O
rudimentary O
but O
somewhat O
clever O
design O
, O
KiloAlfa B-ORG
provides O
keylogging O
capability O
for O
the O
Lazarus B-ORG
Group I-ORG
's I-ORG
collection O
of O

tools O
. O

The O
design O
of O
KiloAlfa B-MISC
is O
broken O
down O
into O
two O
basic O
components O
: O
the O
persistence O
functionality O
and O
the O
keylogging O
functionality O
. O

The O
persistence O
functionality O
of O
KiloAlfa B-ORG
allows O
the O
malware O
to O
self-install O
on O
a O
victim O
's O
machine O
when O
activated O
( O
described O
below O
) O
. O

Evidence O
suggest O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-ORG
Group I-ORG
uses O
compromised O
infrastructure O
as O
the O
public-facing O
touchpoint O
for O
the O
majority O
of O

PapaAlfa B-ORG
is O
believed O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O

uses O
to O
hide O
the O
true O
command O
and O
control O

( O

) O
for O
operations O
. O

Rather O
, O
PapaAlfa B-ORG
could O
be O
considered O
a O
smart O
proxy O
due O
in O
part O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-MISC
can O
easily O
switch O
the O
backend O
destination O
address O
and O
port O
without O
having O
to O
reestablish O
control O
over O
the O
infected O
machine O
hosting O
the O
PapaAlfa B-MISC
malware O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
form O
factor O
, O
PapaAlfa B-MISC
comes O
in O
two O
flavors O
: O
service O
DLL O
and O
standalone O

One O
of O
the O
most O

during O

is O
that O
the O
amount O

significantly O
increased O
after O

published O
our O

Our O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
malware O
authors O
created O
Emissary B-MISC
as O
early O
as O
2009 O
, O
which O
suggests O
that O
threat O

have O
relied O
on O
this O

as O
a O

in O

for O
many O

While O
it O
lacks O
more O

it O
is O
still O
able O
to O
carry O

in O

quickly O

an O

that O
resulted O
in O
version O

in O
June O
2009 O

Between O
August O

November O
2015 O
the O

a O

more O
rapid O
succession O

in O

Version O

one O

October O

the O

represent O

high-payoff O

once O

it O
is O
likely O

be O
relatively O

the O

of O
potentially O
thousands O

broadly O
in O

, O
in O

Observed O

with O

of O
the O

have O
outlined O
previously O
as O
originating O
from O
China B-LOC

In O
line O
with O
commonly O

APT B-MISC
actor O
methodologies O

the O

changes O
made O
to O
APT10 B-MISC
tools O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
( O

) O
post-2014 O
, O
following O
its O
shift O
from O
Poison B-ORG
Ivy I-ORG
to O
PlugX B-ORG
. I-ORG

We O
have O
observed O
that O
in O
cases O
where O
APT10 B-ORG
has O
infiltrated O
a O
target O
via O
an O
MSP B-ORG
, I-ORG
it O
continues O
to O
use O
the O
MSPs B-MISC
credentials O
. O

In O
order O
to O
gain O
any O
further O
credentials O
, O
APT10 B-ORG
will O
usually O
deploy O
credential O
theft O
tools O
such O
as O
mimikatz B-MISC
or O
PwDump B-MISC
, I-MISC
sometimes O
using O
DLL B-MISC
load O
order O
hijacking O
, O
to O
use O
against O
a O
domain O
controller O
, O
explained O
further O
in O
Annex O
B O
. O

APT10 B-ORG
achieves O
persistence O
on O
its O
targets O
primarily O
by O
using O
scheduled O
tasks O
or O
Windows B-MISC
services O
in O
order O
to O
ensure O
the O
malware O
remains O
active O
regardless O
of O
system O
reboots O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
compromising O
high O
value O
domain O
controllers O
and O
security O
servers O
, O
the O
threat O
actor O
has O
also O
been O
observed O
identifying O
and O
subsequently O
installing O
malware O
on O
low O
profile O
systems O
that O
provide O
non-critical O
support O
functions O
to O
the O
business O
, O
and O
are O
thus O
less O
likely O
to O
draw O
the O
attention O
of O
system O
administrators O
. O

In O
the O
majority O
of O
instances O
APT10 B-MISC
used O
either O
a O
reverse O
shell O
or O
RDP B-MISC
connection O
to O
install O
its O
malware O
; O
the O
actor O
also O
uses O
these O
methods O
to O
propagate O
across O
the O
network O
. O

The O
tactical O
malware O
, O
historically O
EvilGrab B-MISC
, I-MISC
and O
now O
ChChes B-MISC
( O
and O
likely O
also O
RedLeaves B-MISC
) I-MISC
, I-MISC
is O
designed O
to O
be O
lightweight O
and O
disposable O
, O
often O
being O
delivered O
through O
spear O
phishing O
. O

Once O
executed O
, O
tactical O
malware O
contains O
the O
capability O
to O
profile O
the O
network O
and O
manoeuvre O
through O
it O
to O
identify O
a O
key O
system O
of O
interest O
. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
APT10 B-MISC
use O
DLL B-MISC
search O
order O
hijacking O
and O
sideloading O
, O
to O
execute O
some O

The O
primary O

used O
by O
Night B-ORG

comprised O
a O
variety O
of O
hacker O
tools O
, O
including O
privately O
developed O

that O
provided O

While O

focused O
specifically O
on O
the O

the O
tools O

of O
this O
kind O
can O
be O
highly O
successful O
when O

that O
are O
prevalent O
on O

We O
have O
been O
presented O
with O
a O
rare O
opportunity O
to O
see O
some O
development O
activities O
from O
the O
actors O
associated O
with O

campaign O
, O
a O

has O
been O
following O
since O

Recently O
we O
were O
able O
to O
observe O
these O
actors O
making O
modifications O
to O
their O
Clayslide B-MISC
delivery O

in O
an O
attempt O
to O
evade O
antivirus O
detection O
. O

We O
collected O
two O
sets O
of O
Clayslide B-MISC
samples O
that O
appear O
to O
be O
created O
during O
the O
OilRig B-MISC
actor O
's O
development O
phase O
of O
their O
attack O
lifecycle O
. O

On O
November O
15 O
, O
2016 O
, O
an O
actor O
related O
to O
the O
OilRig B-ORG
campaign O
began O
testing O
the O
Clayslide B-MISC
delivery O
documents O
. O

The O
actor O
then O
made O
subtle O
modifications O
to O
the O
file O
and O
uploaded O
the O
newly O
created O
file O
to O
the O
same O
popular O
antivirus O
testing O
website O
in O
order O
to O
determine O
how O
to O
evade O

In O
addition O
to O
making O
changes O
to O
the O
Excel B-MISC
worksheets O
that O
contain O
the O
decoy O
content O
, O
the O
actor O
also O
made O
changes O
to O
the O
worksheet O
that O
is O
initially O
displayed O
to O
the O
user O
. O

Taking O
a O
step O
back O
, O
as O
discussed O
in O
the O
Appendix B-ORG
in O
our O
initial O
OilRig B-MISC
blog O
, O
Clayslide B-ORG

initially O

, O
which O
in O
fact O
runs O
the O
malicious O

This O
realization O
suggests O
that O
the O
OilRig B-MISC
threat O
group O
will O
continue O
to O
use O
their O
delivery O
documents O
for O
extended O
periods O
with O

remain O
effective O

an O

However O
, O
the O

Interestingly O

Instead O
, O

on O

It O
is O
not O
the O

, O
we O
have O

such O
as O

Starting O
in O
March O
2018 O
, O
we O
observed O
a O
significant O
change O
in O
the O

: O
it O
now O
leverages O
the O
open O

Metasploit B-MISC
before O
dropping O
the O

Even O
an O

can O
be O
fooled O
by O

a O

apparently O
from O

since O

However O
, O
to O
our O
knowledge O
, O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
Turla B-ORG
has O
used O
Metasploit B-MISC
as O
a O
first O

instead O

from O
mid-2016 O

However O
, O
despite O
the O
similarities O
to O
previous O
Turla B-MISC
campaigns O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
WhiteBear B-ORG
is O
a O
distinct O
project O
with O
a O
separate O
focus O
. O

From O
February O
to O
September O
2016 O
, O
WhiteBear B-ORG
activity O
was O
narrowly O
focused O
on O
embassies O
and O
consular O
operations O
around O
the O
world O
. O

Continued O
WhiteBear B-ORG
activity O
later O
shifted O
to O
include O
defense-related O
organizations O
into O
June O
2017 O
. O

All O
of O
these O
early O
WhiteBear B-ORG
targets O
were O
related O
to O
embassies O
and O
diplomatic/foreign O
affair O
organizations O
. O

Thus O
, O
Turla B-ORG
operators O
had O
access O
to O
some O
highly O
sensitive O
information O
( O
such O
as O
emails O
sent O
by O
the O
German B-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Office I-ORG
staff O
) O
for O
almost O
a O
year O
. O

Our O
investigation O
also O
led O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
dozens O
of O
email O
addresses O
registered O
by O
Turla B-ORG
operators O
for O
this O
campaign O
and O
used O
to O
receive O
exfiltrated O

from O
the O

. O

It O
mainly O

also O

First O
, O
Turla B-PER
steals O
emails O
by O
forwarding O
all O
outgoing O

to O
the O
attackers O
. O

We O
identified O
several O
European B-MISC
governments O
and O
defense O
companies O
compromised O
with O
this O
group O
. O

What O
actually O
happens O
is O
that O
the O
malware O
is O
able O
to O
decode O
data O
from O
the O
PDF B-MISC
documents O
and O
interpret O
it O
as O
commands O
for O
the O
backdoor O
. O

In O
early O
2018 O
, O
multiple O
media O
claimed O
that O
Turla B-ORG
operators O
used O
mail O
attachments O
to O
control O
infected O
machines O
. O

As O
detailed O
in O
the O
previous O
section O
, O
this O
malware O
is O
able O
to O
manipulate O
and O
exfiltrate O
emails O
. O

To O
our O
knowledge O
, O
Turla B-ORG
is O
the O
only O
espionage O
group O
that O
currently O
uses O
a O
backdoor O
entirely O
controlled O
by O
emails O
, O
and O
more O
specifically O
via O
PDF B-MISC
attachments O
. O

The O
attackers O
first O
infected O
in O
March O
2017 O
. O

Our O
research O
shows O
that O
compromised O
organizations O
are O
at O
risk O
of O
not O
only O
being O
spied O
on O
by O
the O
Turla B-ORG
group O
who O
planted O
the O
backdoor O
, O
but O
also O
by O
other O
attackers O
. O

The O
developers O
refer O
to O
this O
tool O
by O
the O
name O
Kazuar B-MISC
, I-MISC
which O
is O
a O
Trojan B-MISC
written O
using O
the O
Microsoft.NET B-MISC
Framework I-MISC
that O
offers O
actors O
complete O
access O
to O
compromised O
systems O
targeted O
by O
its O
operator O
. O

We O
suspect O
the O
Kazuar B-LOC
tool O
may O
be O
linked O
to O
the O
Turla B-LOC
threat O
actor O
group O
( O
also O
known O
as O
Uroburos B-MISC
and O
Snake B-MISC
) I-MISC
, I-MISC

, O

organizations O
across O
the O
globe O
. O

This O
is O
also O
a O
full-featured O
backdoor O
controlled O
by O
email O
, O
and O
which O
can O
work O
independently O
of O
any O
other O
Turla B-LOC
component O
. O

A O
hallmark O
of O
Turla B-LOC
operations O
is O
iterations O
of O
their O
tools O
and O
code O
lineage O
in O
Kazuar B-LOC
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
at O

2005 O
. O

If O
the O
hypothesis O

, O
named O
for O
the O

the O
actors O
often O
use O

their O
Poison B-MISC

malware O
. O

Over O
the O
summer O
they O
compromised O
several O
sites O
, O
including O
a O
well-known O
Uyghur B-MISC
website O
written O
in O
that O
native O
language O
. O

In O
contrast O
to O
many O
other O
APT B-MISC
campaigns O
, O
which O
tend O
to O
rely O
heavily O
on O
spear O

. O

While O
we O
were O
unable O
to O
recover O
the O
initial O
vulnerability O
used O
, O
it O
is O
possibly O
the O
same O
CVE-2014-0515 O
Adobe B-MISC
Flash I-MISC
exploit O
first O
reported O
by O
Cisco B-ORG
TRAC I-ORG
in O

. O

However O
, O
to O
increase O
success O
rates O
APT20 O
can O
use O
zero-day O
exploits O
, O
so O
even O
a O
properly O

would O
be O
compromised O
. O

Our O
direct O
observation O
of O
in-the-wild O
spearphishing O
attacks O
staged O
by O
the O
Bahamut B-ORG
group O
have O
been O
solely O
attempts O
to O
deceive O

into O
providing O
account O

through O
impersonation O
of O

from O

Bahamut B-PER
was O
first O
noticed O
when O
it O
targeted O
a O
Middle B-MISC
Eastern I-MISC
human O
rights O
activist O
in O
the O
first O
week O
of O
January O
2017 O
. O

Later O
that O
month O
, O
the O
same O
tactics O
and O
patterns O
were O
seen O
in O
attempts O
against O
an O
Iranian B-MISC
women O
's O
activist O
– O
an O
individual O
commonly O
targeted O
by O
Iranian B-MISC
actors O
, O
such O
as O
Charming B-PER
Kitten I-PER
and O
the O
Sima B-PER
campaign O
documented O
in O
our O
2016 O
Black B-MISC

. O

In O
June O
we O
published O
on O
a O
previously O
unknown O
group O
we O
named O
" O
Bahamut B-MISC
" O
, O
a O
strange O
campaign O
of O
phishing O
and O
malware O
apparently O
focused O
on O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
and O
South B-LOC

Once O
inside O

allowing O

it O

to O
towards O
the O
ultimate O
goal O
of O

Bahamut B-PER
was O
shown O
to O
be O
resourceful O
, O
not O
only O
maintaining O
their O
own O
Android B-MISC

but O
running O
propaganda O
sites O

although O
the O
quality O
of O

varied O

However O
, O
in O
the O
same O
week O
of O
September O
a O
series O
of O
spearphishing O
attempts O
once O
again O
targeted O
a O
set O
of O
otherwise O
unrelated O
individuals O
, O
employing O
the O
same O
tactics O
as O
before O
. O

Our O
primary O
contribution O
in O
this O
update O
is O
to O
implicate O
Bahamut B-PER
in O
what O
are O
likely O
counterterrorism-motivated O
surveillance O
operations O
, O
and O
to O
further O
affirm O
our O
belief O
that O
the O
group O
is O
a O
hacker-for-hire O
operation O
. O

As O
we O
wrote O
then O
, O
compared O
to O
Kingphish B-MISC
, I-MISC
Bahamut B-LOC
operates O
as O
though O
it O
were O
a O
generation O
ahead O
in O
terms O
of O
professionalism O
and O
ambition O
. O

In O
the O
Bahamut B-LOC
report O
, O
we O
discussed O
two O
domains O
found O
within O
our O
search O
that O
were O
linked O
with O
a O
custom O
Android B-MISC
malware O
agent O
. O

After O
the O
publication O
of O
the O
original O
report O
, O
these O
sites O
were O
taken O
offline O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
one O
agent O
was O
even O
updated O
a O
six O
days O
prior O
to O
our O
post O
( O

notable O

, O
which O
has O
committed O

of O
establishing O

over O
the O
disputed O

. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
it O
is O
already O
flagged O
as O
Bahamut B-MISC
by O
antivirus O
engines O
. O

Our O
initial O
observation O
of O
the O
Bahamut B-MISC
group O
originated O
from O
in-the-wild O
attempts O
to O
deceive O
targets O
into O
providing O
account O
passwords O
through O
impersonation O
of O
platform O
providers O
. O

One O
curious O
trait O
of O
Bahamut B-MISC
is O
that O
it O
develops O
fully-functional O
applications O
in O
support O
of O
its O
espionage O
activities O
, O
rather O
than O
push O
nonfunctional O
fake O
apps O
or O
bundle O
malware O
with O
legitimate O
software O
. O

Curiously O
, O
Bahamut B-PER
appears O
to O
track O
password O
attempts O
in O
response O
to O
failed O
phishing O
attempts O
or O
to O
provoke O
the O
target O
to O
provide O
more O
passwords O
. O

Bahamut B-ORG
spearphishing O
attempts O
have O
also O
been O
accompanied O
with O
SMS O
messages O
purporting O
to O
be O
from O
Google B-ORG
about O
security O
issues O
on O
their O
account O
, O
including O
a O
class O
0 O
message O
or O
" O
flash O
text O
" O
. O

These O
text O
messages O
did O
not O
include O
links O
but O
are O
intended O
to O
build O
credibility O
around O
the O
fake O
service O
notifications O
later O
sent O
to O
the O
target O
's O
email O
address O
. O

We O
have O
not O
found O
evidence O
of O
Bahamut B-ORG
engaging O
in O
crime O
or O
operating O
outside O
its O
limited O
geographic O
domains O
, O
although O
this O
narrow O
perspective O
could O
be O
accounted O
for O
by O
its O
compartmentalization O
of O
operations O
. O

Thus O
far O
, O
Bahamut B-PER
's I-PER
campaigns O
have O
appeared O
to O
be O
primarily O
espionage O
or O
information O
operations O
– O
not O
destructive O

or O

. O

The O

The O

speculate O
that O

We O
believe O
that O
it O

continue O

use O

however O
, O
after O

we O
think O
these O
static O
dates O
could O
also O
be O
a O
build O
identifier O
for O
the O
Trojan B-MISC

Threat O
actors O
may O
use O
the O
date O
string O
hardcoded O
into O
each O

as O
a O
build O
identifier O

A O
Trojan B-MISC
sending O
a O
build O

quite O
common O

notifies O

Due O
to O
these O
changes O
without O
a O
new O
date O
string O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
date O
codes O
are O
used O
for O
campaign O
tracking O
rather O
than O
a O
Bookworm O
build O
identifier O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Bookworm O
samples O
use O
the O
static O
date O
string O
as O
campaign O

which O
we O
used O
to O
determine O

Buhtrap B-ORG
has O
been O
active O
since O
2014 O
, O
however O
their O
first O
attacks O
against O
financial O
institutions O
were O
only O
detected O
in O
August O
2015 O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
the O
group O
is O
known O
to O
target O
Russian B-MISC
and O
Ukrainian B-MISC
banks O
. O

Buhtrap B-ORG
is O
the O
first O
hacker O
group O
using O
a O
network O
worm O
to O
infect O
the O
overall O
bank O
infrastructure O
that O
significantly O
increases O
the O
difficulty O
of O
removing O
all O
malicious O
functions O
from O
the O
network O
. O

Malicious O
programs O
intentionally O
scan O
for O
machines O
with O
an O
automated O
Bank-Customer B-MISC
system O
of O
the O
Central B-ORG
bank I-ORG
of I-ORG
Russia I-ORG
( O
further O
referred O
to O

) O
. O

If O
the O
document O
was O
delivered O
with O
macros O
instead O
of O
exploits O
( O
CVE-2012-0158 O
, O
CVE-2013-3906 O
or O
CVE-2014-1761 O
) O
, O
then O
the O
document O
contained O
instructions O
for O
enabling O
macros O
. O

We O
noticed O
that O
criminals O
were O
spreading O
Buhtrap B-MISC
using O
this O
method O
from O
May O
2015 O
to O
August O
2015 O
. O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
attackers O
used O
the O
same O
compromised O
websites O
to O
spread O
Buhtrap B-MISC
as O
those O
that O
had O
been O
used O
for O
the O
Corkow B-MISC
Trojan I-MISC
. I-MISC

Moreover O
, O
they O
used O
the O
same O
exploit O
kit O
Niteris B-MISC
as O
that O
in O
the O
Corkow B-PER
case O
. O

Purportedly O
during O
one O
of O
the O
first O
attacks O
hackers O
intercepted O
the O
mailing O
list O
of O
the O
Anti-drop B-MISC
" O
club O
and O
created O
a O
specific O
phishing O
email O
for O
its O
members O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
still O
widely O
used O
, O
notably O
in O
Russia B-LOC
. I-LOC

As O
noted O
in O
our O
previous O
blog O
on O
Buhtrap B-MISC
, I-MISC
this O
gang O
has O
been O
actively O
targeting O
Russian B-MISC
businesses O
, O
mostly O
through O
spear-phishing O
. O

It O
is O
thus O
interesting O
to O
see O
Buhtrap B-MISC
add O
strategic O
web O
compromises O
to O
their O
arsenal O
. O

The O
first O
malware O
we O
saw O
was O
the O
lurk O
downloader O
, O
which O
was O
distributed O
on O
October O
26th O
. O

The O
executable O
would O
install O
the O
real O
Ammyy B-MISC
product O
, O
but O
would O
also O
launch O
a O
file O
called O
either O
AmmyyService.exe B-MISC
or O
AmmyySvc.exe B-MISC
which O
contained O
the O
malicious O
payload O
. O

Buhtrap B-ORG
is O
getting O
better O
at O
disguising O
the O
code O
they O
inject O
into O
compromised O
websites O
. O

With O
the O
recent O
arrests O
of O
actors O
using O
the O
Lurk B-MISC
banking O
trojan O
, O
Buhtrap B-MISC
appears O
to O
be O
a O
likely O
alternative O
for O
actors O
wishing O
to O
target O
Russian B-MISC
banks O
and O
software O
. O

They O
have O
different O
functions O
and O
ways O
of O
spreading O
, O
but O
the O
same O
purpose O
— O
to O
steal O
money O
from O
the O
accounts O
of O
businesses O
. O

Our O
experts O
have O
found O
that O
cybercriminals O
are O
actively O
focusing O
on O
SMBs B-MISC
, I-MISC
and O
giving O
particular O
attention O
to O
accountants O
. O

The O
first O
encounter O
with O
Buhtrap B-ORG
was O
registered O
back O
in O
2014 O
. O

For O
now O
, O
we O
can O
call O
RTM B-ORG
one O
of O
the O
most O
active O
financial O
Trojans B-ORG
. I-ORG

At O
that O
time O
it O
was O
the O
name O
of O
a O
cybercriminal O
group O
that O
was O
stealing O
money O
from O
Russian B-MISC
financial O
establishments O
— O
to O
the O
tune O
of O
at O
least O
$150,000 O
per O
hit O
. O

Buhtrap B-ORG
resurfaced O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
2017 O
in O
the O
TwoBee B-ORG
campaign O
, O
where O
it O
served O
primarily O
as O
means O
of O
malware O
delivery O
. O

After O
the O
source O
codes O
of O
their O
tools O
became O
public O
in O
2016 O
, O
the O
name O
Buhtrap B-MISC
was O
used O
for O
the O
financial O
Trojan B-MISC
. I-MISC

Just O
like O
last O
time O
, O
Buhtrap B-MISC
is O
spreading O
through O
exploits O
embedded O
in O
news O
outlets O
. O

Estimating O
the O
damages O
is O
challenging O
, O
but O
as O
we O
learned O
, O
the O
criminals O
are O
siphoning O
off O
assets O
in O
transactions O
that O
do O
not O
exceed O
$15,000 O
each O
. O

As O
explained O
later O
, O
we O
believe O
this O
campaign O
is O
financially-motivated O
and O
that O
it O
targets O
accounting O
departments O
in O
Russian B-MISC
businesses O
. O

" O

Seeing O
a O
campaign O
like O
this O
, O
inevitably O
the O
Anunak/Carbanak B-ORG
documented O
by O
Fox-IT B-ORG
and O
Kaspersky B-ORG
comes O
to O
mind O
. O

The O
infection O
vector O
is O
similar O
, O
it O
uses O
a O
similar O
modified O
mimikatz O
application O
, O
and O
it O
uses O
a O
third-party O
remote O
access O
tool O
, O
changes O

settings O
to O
allow O
concurrent O

Sometimes O
, O
the O

use O

to O
make O

an O

the O

by O

a O
strong O
affinity O
for O

to O

this O
is O
relatively O
unique O
amongst O

attackers O
who O
often O
favor O
targeting O
a O

at O
a O

Clever B-MISC

primarily O
targets O
global O

with O
strategic O
importance O
to O
countries O
that O
are O
contrary O
to O

interests O
. O

A O
Clever B-MISC

attack O
starts O
with O
the O
use O
of O
a O

The O
scanner O
was O
identified O
as O

is O
a O

will O
attempt O
to O
upload O
a O
PHP O
backdoor O
to O
gain O
remote O
access O
to O
the O

The O
reason O
for O
this O
is O
likely O
the O
availability O
of O

which O
for O
a O

During O

Threat O
actors O
like O
Confucius B-MISC
and O
Patchwork B-ORG
are O
known O
for O
their O
large O
arsenal O
of O
tools O
and O
ever-evolving O
techniques O
that O
can O
render O
traditional O

not O

the O
persistent O
and O
sophisticated O
threats O
detailed O
in O

The O
reality O
is O
that O
IT O
departments O
of O
small O
to O
large-sized O
organizations O
are O
not O
equipped O
to O
handle O
the O
more O

that O

This O

examines O
two O

that O
utilize O
the O

abuse O

and O
their O

In O

to O
increase O
the O
likelihood O
of O

successfully O

are O
increasingly O

In O
2013 O
, O
Rapid7 B-ORG
reported O
on O
a O
series O
of O
relatively O
amateur O
attacks O
against O
Pakistani B-MISC
targets O
. O

The O
first O
of O
which O
we O
call O
' O
CONFUCIUS_A B-MISC
' I-MISC
, I-MISC
a O
malware O
family O
that O
has O
links O

a O

associated O

method O
commonly O
known O
as O
SNEEPY B-ORG
( O
aka O
ByeByeShell O
) O
first O
reported O
by O
Rapid7 B-ORG
in O
2013 O
. O

At O
first O
glance O
CONFUCIUS_B O
looks O
very O
similar O
to O
CONFUCIUS_A B-MISC
, I-MISC
and O
they O
are O
also O
packaged O
in O
plain O
SFX B-ORG
binary O
files O
. O

The O
CONFUCIUS_B B-MISC
executable O
is O
disguised O
as O
a O

presentation O
, O
using O
a O
Right-To-Left-Override B-MISC
( O
RTLO O
) O
trick O
and O
a O
false O
icon O
. O

We O
also O
believe O
that O
both O
clusters O
of O
activity O
have O
links O
to O
attacks O
with O
likely O
Indian B-MISC
origins O
, O
the O
CONFUCIUS_A B-MISC
attacks O
are O
linked O
to O
the O
use O
of O

The O
two O

families O
themselves O
are O
also O
very O
similar O
, O
and O
therefore O
we O
think O
that O
the O
shared O
technique O
is O
an O
indication O
of O
a O
single O
developer O
, O
or O

, O
behind O
both O
CONFUCIUS_A B-MISC

an O

It O
wasn't O
until O
August O

that O
we O
observed O
something O
which O
made O
us O
wonder O
if O

back O
for O
good O
. O

The O
Cloud B-MISC
Atlas I-MISC

utilize O
a O
rather O
unusual O
C&C O

We O
named O
it O
RedOctober B-ORG
because O
we O
started O
this O

in O
October O
2012 O

an O
unusually O
hot O

that O

our O

strongly O
supports O
the O

the O

specialists O
in O
companies O

that O
increasingly O
find O
themselves O
the O
targets O
of O
cyber-attacks O
. O

In O
most O
cases O
, O
the O
attackers O
only O
had O
to O
infect O
the O
computer O
on O
which O
the O
RBS B-ORG
software O
was O
installed O
in O

to O

We O
were O
soon O
able O
to O
help O
investigate O
another O
incident O
involving O
Lurk B-PER
. I-PER

This O
event O
significantly O
affected O
the O
Russian B-MISC
cybercriminal O
world O
as O
the O
gang O
had O
stolen O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
of O
rubles O
during O
a O
few O
years O
of O
activity O
, O
and O
was O
considered O
a O
" O
leader O
" O
among O
cybercriminals O
. O

In O
Russia B-LOC
, I-LOC
there O
were O
several O
relatively O
large O
cybercriminal O
groups O
engaged O
in O
financial O
theft O
via O
attacks O
on O
RBS B-ORG
. I-ORG

In O
April O
2013 O
, O
a O
year O
after O
we O
found O
the O
" O
bodiless O
" O
Lurk O
module O
, O
the O
Russian B-MISC
cybercriminal O
underground O
exploited O
several O
families O
of O
malicious O
software O
that O
specialized O
in O
attacks O
on O
banking O
software O
. O

Through O
the O
information O
exchanges O
used O
by O
people O
in O
the O
security O
industry O
, O
we O
learned O
that O
several O
Russian B-MISC
banks O
were O
struggling O
with O
malicious O
programs O
created O
specifically O
to O
attack O
a O
particular O
type O
of O
legal O
banking O
software O
. O

If O
it O
did O
, O
the O
malware O
downloaded O
additional O
modules O

including O
ones O
allowing O
for O
the O
automatic O
creation O
of O

As O
far O
as O
we O
can O
judge O
from O
the O
data O
we O
have O
, O
in O
2014 O
the O
criminal O
group O
behind O

seriously O
reduced O

We O

' O

on O

we O
saw O
within O
the O
samples O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
compiler O
used O
to O
generate O
the O
samples O
. O

The O
attackers O
compromised O
two O
legitimate O
Thai B-MISC
websites O
to O
host O
the O
malware O
, O
which O
is O
a O
tactic O
this O
group O
has O
used O
in O
the O
past O

Both O
the O
Trochilus B-MISC

attackers O
used O
different O
command O

control O

( O
C2s O
) O
for O
each O
malware O
family O
, O
a O
tactic O
we O
believe O
was O
meant O
to O
thwart O
attempts O
to O
tie O
the O
attacks O
together O
using O

Further O
research O
led O
us O
to O
additional O

using O

the O

The O

deployed O
in O
both O

are O
updated O
versions O
of O

This O
behavioural O

was O
previously O
mentioned O
in O

to O
KeyBoy B-ORG
in O
a O
2013 O

by O

These O

differed O
from O

several O

We O
believe O
the O
2013 O
, O
2015 O
, O
and O
2016 O
KeyBoy B-MISC
samples O
provide O
evidence O
of O
a O

that O
would O
be O

are O
about O
even O

that O

any O

of O
the O

about O
a O

that O
it O
follows O

called O
Mofang B-MISC

The O
name O
Mofang B-MISC
is O
based O
on O
the O
Mandarin B-MISC

which O
means O

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
that O
the O
Mofang B-ORG

is O
a O

that O
operates O
out O
of O

are O
merely O
their O
latest O
attack O
wave O
. O

The O
goal O
of O
the O
attackers O
appears O
to O
be O
to O
collect O
intellectual O
property O
such O
as O

, O

, O
and O

The O
attack O
wave O
started O
in O
late O
July O
2011 O
and O
continued O
into O
midSeptember O

. O

The O
purpose O
of O
the O
attacks O
appears O
to O
be O
industrial O
espionage O
, O
collecting O

for O

They O
then O
moved O
on O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O

The O
attackers O
first O
researched O

then O
sent O
an O

the O

First O
, O
when O
a O
specific O
recipient O
was O
targeted O
, O
the O
mails O
often O
purported O
to O
be O
meeting O
invitations O
from O
established O
business O
partners O
. O

While O
the O
attackers O
used O
different O
pretexts O
when O
sending O
these O
malicious O
emails O
, O
two O
methodologies O
stood O
out O
. O

Secondly O
, O
when O
the O

were O
being O
sent O

a O
broad O
set O
of O
recipients O
, O
the O
mails O
purported O
to O

a O
necessary O

The O
attacks O
were O
traced O

The O
main O
point O
that O
sets O
Operation B-MISC

apart O
from O
the O
other O

is O
that O
it O
has O
mostly O
been O

self-declared O
Donetsk B-LOC

The O

appear O
to O
be O
geopolitically O
motivated O

target O
high O

The O
objective O
of O
the O
attacks O
is O
clearly O
espionage O

they O
involve O
gaining O

, O

around O

The O

The O
main O
reason O
for O
the O

were O

financial O
institutions O
. O

The O
infection O
vector O
is O
a O
spear-phishing O
email O
with O
a O
malicious O
attachment O
. O

An O
interesting O
point O
in O
the O
Silence O
attack O
is O
that O
the O
cybercriminals O
had O
already O
compromised O
banking O
infrastructure O
in O
order O
to O
send O
their O
spear-phishing O
emails O
from O
the O
addresses O
of O
real O
bank O
employees O
and O
look O
as O
unsuspicious O
as O
possible O
to O
future O
victims O
. O

The O
spear-phishing O
infection O
vector O
is O
still O
the O
most O
popular O
way O
to O
initiate O
targeted O
campaigns O
. O

We O
conclude O
that O
the O
actor O
behind O
the O
attack O
is O
Silence B-ORG
group O
, O
a O
relatively O
new O
threat O
actor O
that's O
been O
operating O
since O
mid-2016 O
. O

A O
preliminary O
analysis O
caught O
the O
attention O
of O
our O
Threat B-ORG
Analysis I-ORG
and I-ORG
Intelligence I-ORG
team O
as O
it O
yielded O
interesting O
data O
that O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
shows O
that O
Silence B-ORG
was O
targeting O
employees O
from O
financial O
entities O
, O
specifically O
in O
the O
Russian B-LOC
Federation I-LOC
and O
the O
Republic B-LOC
of I-LOC
Belarus I-LOC

As O
shown O
above O
, O
the O
threat O
runs O
several O
native O
binaries O
to O
collect O
useful O
information O
for O
its O
recon O
phase O
. O

The O
intelligence O
we O
have O
collected O
shows O
that O
Silence O
is O
part O
of O
a O
more O
extensive O
operation O
, O
still O
focused O
on O
financial O
institutions O
operating O
mainly O
on O
Russian B-MISC
territory O
. O

These O
spearphishing O
attempts O
represent O
an O
evolution O
of O
Iranian B-MISC
actors O
based O
on O
their O
social O
engineering O
tactics O
and O
narrow O
targeting O
. O

Based O
on O
file O
modification O
dates O
and O
timestamps O
of O
samples O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
observed O
campaign O
was O
initiated O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
February O
2016 O
, O
with O
the O
infrastructure O
taken O
offline O
at O
the O
start O
of O
March O
. O

While O
the O
Sima B-PER
moniker O
could O
similarly O
originate O
from O
software O
labels O
, O
it O
is O
a O
common O
female O
Persian B-MISC
name O
and O
a O
Persian-language B-MISC
word O
for O
" O
visage O
" O
or O
" O

. O

Given O
its O
use O
in O
more O
advanced O
social O
engineering O
campaigns O
against O
women O
's O
rights O
activists O
, O
the O
label O
seem O
particularly O
apt O
. O

Samples O
and O
resource O
names O
contained O
the O
family O

of O
prominent O
Iranians B-MISC

several O
of O
these O

received O
the O

located O
in O

The O

In O
another O

, O
Sima B-PER
mirrored O
an O

made O
about O
the O

of O
a O

in O
order O
to O
impersonate O
the O

and O
engage O
in O
spearphishing O
within O
hours O
of O
the O
legitimate O
message O
. O

The O
server O
used O
to O
host O
these O
malware O
samples O
was O
located O
on O
the O
German B-MISC

All O
the O

appear O
to O
be O

been O
compiled O
between O
February O
29 O
and O
March O
1 O
2016 O

be O

These O
archives O
provide O
further O
indication O
that O
those O
entities O
behind O
the O
campaigns O
are O
Persian-language B-MISC
speakers O
, O
due O
to O
the O
naming O
of O

For O
the O
sake O
of O
narrative O
we O
are O
going O
to O
focus O
exclusively O
to O
those O

we O
identified O
being O

in O

Butterfly B-ORG
has O
attacked O
multi-billion O
dollar O
companies O
operating O
in O
the O
internet O
, O
IT O

, O
pharmaceutical O
, O
and O

sectors O
. O

The O
first O
signs O
of O
Butterfly B-ORG

activities O
emerged O
in O
early O
2013 O
when O
several O
major O
technology O
and O
internet O
firms O
were O
compromised O
. O

However O
, O
an O
investigation O
by O
Symantec B-ORG
has O
found O
that O
the O
group O
has O
been O
active O
since O
at O

March O
2012 O
and O
its O
attacks O
have O
not O
only O
continued O
to O
the O
present O
day O
, O
but O
have O
also O
increased O
in O
number O
. O

Symantec B-ORG
has O
to O
date O
discovered O
49 O
different O
organizations O
in O
more O
than O
20 O
countries O
that O
have O
been O
attacked O
by O
Butterfly B-ORG

Aside O
from O
the O
four O
companies O
which O
have O
publicly O
acknowledged O

, O
Symantec B-ORG
has O
identified O
five O
other O
large O
technology O
firms O
compromised O
by O
Butterfly B-ORG
, I-ORG
primarily O
headquartered O
in O
the O
US B-LOC

In O
the O
first O
attack O
, O
Butterfly B-ORG
gained O
a O
foothold O
by O
first O
attacking O
a O
small O
European B-MISC
office O
belonging O
to O
one O
firm O
and O
using O
this O
infection O
to O
then O
move O
on O
to O
its O

However O
, O

is O
not O
the O
only O

has O
focused O
on O
and O
Symantec B-ORG
has O
found O
evidence O
that O
Butterfly B-ORG
has O
attacked O
three O
major O
European B-MISC
pharmaceutical O
firms O
. O

Butterfly O
has O
also O
shown O
an O
interest O
in O
the O
commodities O
sector O
, O
attacking O
two O
major O
companies O
involved O
in O
gold O

The O

one O
of O
at O

three O

Butterfly B-ORG
has O
targeted O
over O
the O

three O
years O

After O
reviewing O
all O
the O

we O
are O
confident O
in O
saying O
that O
the O
attackers O
look O
for O
victims O
who O
answer O
well-defined O
characteristics O

believe O
that O
further O

With O
the O
experience O

from O
the O

it O

In O
the O
Sea B-MISC
Turtle I-MISC
campaign O
, O
Talos B-PER
was O
able O
to O
identify O
two O
distinct O
groups O
of O
victims O
. O

The O
first O
group O
, O
we O
identify O
as O
primary O
victims O
, O
includes O
national O
security O
organizations O
, O
ministries O
of O
foreign O
affairs O
, O
and O
prominent O
energy O
organizations O
. O

The O
threat O
actors O
behind O
the O
Sea B-ORG
Turtle I-ORG
campaign O
show O
clear O
signs O
of O
being O
highly O
capable O
and O
brazen O
in O
their O
endeavors O
. O

In O
most O
cases O
, O
threat O
actors O
typically O
stop O
or O
slow O
down O
their O
activities O
once O
their O
campaigns O
are O
publicly O
revealed O
. O

The O
threat O
actors O
behind O
the O
Sea B-ORG
Turtle I-ORG
campaign O
were O
successful O
in O
compromising O
entities O
by O
manipulating O
and O
falsifying O
DNS O
records O
at O
various O
levels O
in O
the O
domain O
name O

If O
an O
attacker O
was O
able O
to O
compromise O
an O
organization's O
network O
administrator O
credentials O
, O
the O
attacker O
would O
be O
able O
to O
change O
that O
particular O
organization's O
DNS O
records O
at O
will O
. O

If O
the O
attackers O
were O
able O
to O
obtain O
one O
of O
these O
EPP B-ORG
keys O
, O
they O
would O
be O
able O
to O
modify O
any O
DNS B-MISC
records O
that O
were O
managed O
by O
that O
particular O
registrar O

Captured O
legitimate O

when O

The O
diagram O
below O
illustrates O
how O
we O
believe O
the O
actors O
behind O
the O
Sea B-ORG
Turtle I-ORG
campaign O
used O
DNS O
hijacking O
to O
achieve O
their O
end O
goals O
. O

As O
of O
early O
2019 O
, O
the O
only O
evidence O
of O
the O
spear-phishing O
threat O
vector O
came O
from O
a O
compromised O
organization's O
public O
disclosure O
. O

On O
January O

, O
Packet B-ORG
Clearing I-ORG
House I-ORG
, I-ORG
which O
is O
not O
an O
Internet B-MISC
exchange O
point O
but O
rather O
is O
an O
NGO B-ORG
which O
provides O
support O
to O
Internet B-MISC
exchange O
points O
and O
the O
core O
of O
the O
domain O
name O
system O
, O
provided O
confirmation O
of O
this O
aspect O
of O
the O
actors’ O
tactics O
when O
it O
publicly O
revealed O
its O
internal O
DNS B-MISC
had O
been O
briefly O
hijacked O
as O
a O
consequence O
of O
the O
compromise O
at O
its O
domain O
registrar O
. O

During O
a O
typical O
incident O
, O
the O
actor O
would O
modify O
the O
NS B-ORG
records O
for O
the O
targeted O
organization O
, O
pointing O
users O
to O
a O
malicious O
DNS B-MISC
server O
that O
provided O
actor-controlled O
responses O
to O
all O
DNS O
queries O
. O

The O
next O
step O
for O
the O
actor O
was O
to O
build O
MitM B-ORG
servers O
that O
impersonated O
legitimate O
services O
to O
capture O
user O
credentials O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
MitM B-ORG
server O
IP O
addresses O
published O
in O
previous O
reports O
, O
Talos B-ORG
identified O
16 O
additional O
servers O
leveraged O
by O
the O
actor O
during O
the O
observed O
attacks O
. O

The O
attackers O
would O
then O
use O
the O
certificate O
on O
actor-controlled O
servers O
to O
perform O
additional O
MitM B-ORG
operations O
to O
harvest O
additional O
credentials O
. O

In O
some O
cases O
, O
the O
victims O
were O
redirected O
to O
these O
actor-controlled O
servers O
displaying O
the O
stolen O
certificate O
. O

One O
notable O
aspect O
of O
the O
campaign O
was O
the O
actors' O
ability O
to O
impersonate O
VPN B-MISC
applications O
, O
such O
as O
Cisco B-ORG
Adaptive I-ORG
Security I-ORG
Appliance I-ORG
(ASA) B-ORG
products O
, O
to O
perform O
MitM B-MISC
attacks O
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
we O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
the O
attackers O
found O
a O
new O
ASA B-ORG
exploit O
. O

Rather O
, O
they O
likely O
abused O
the O
trust O
relationship O
associated O
with O
the O
ASA's B-ORG
SSL B-ORG
certificate O
to O
harvest O
VPN B-MISC
credentials O
to O
gain O
remote O
access O
to O
the O
victim's O
network O
. O

As O
an O
example O
, O
DNS B-ORG
records O
indicate O
that O
a O
targeted O
domain O
resolved O
to O
an O
actor-controlled O
MitM B-MISC
server O
. O

In O
another O
case O
, O
the O
attackers O
were O
able O
to O
compromise O
NetNod B-ORG
, I-ORG
a O
non-profit O
, O
independent O
internet O
infrastructure O
organization O
based O
in O
Sweden B-LOC

Using O
this O
access O
, O
the O
threat O
actors O
were O
able O
to O
manipulate O
the O
DNS O
records O
for O
sa1[.]dnsnode[.]net O
. O

This O
redirection O
allowed O
the O
attackers O
to O

of O

the O

In O
one O
of O
the O
more O
recent O
campaigns O
on O
March O

, O
2019 O
, O
the O
threat O
actors O
targeted O
the O
Sweden-based B-MISC
consulting O
firm O
Cafax B-ORG
. I-ORG

We O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
Sea B-ORG
Turtle I-ORG
was O
targeted O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
re-establish O
access O
to O
the O
NetNod B-MISC
network O
, O
which O
was O
previously O
compromised O
by O
this O
threat O
actor O
. O

Obtaining O
access O
to O
this O
ccTLD O
registrars O
would O
have O
allowed O
attackers O
to O
hijack O
any O
domain O
that O
used O
those O
ccTLDs O
. O

These O
actors O

DNS O
hijacking O
through O
the O

of O

and O
a O
number O
of O

including O
those O

Sectigo B-MISC
, I-MISC
and O
self-signed O

Once O

they O
steal O
the O

However O
, O
as O
this O

Despite O
this O

be O
traced O

Operation B-MISC
Pawn I-MISC
Storm I-MISC
is O
an O
active O
economic O

We O
believe O
the O
iOS B-MISC
malware O
gets O
installed O
on O
already O
compromised O
systems O
, O
and O
it O
is O
very O
similar O

The O
obvious O
goal O

Assuming O

a O

Turla's B-PER

The O
earliest O
step O
in O
any O
possible O
attack(s) O
involving O
this O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak B-MISC
of O
which O
Proofpoint B-ORG
researchers O
are O
currently O
aware O
begin O
with O
the O
MSIL B-ORG
dropper O
. O

The O
basic O
chain O
of O
events O
upon O
execution O
of O
the O
MSIL B-ORG
dropper O
include O
dropping O
and O
executing O
both O
a O
PDF O
decoy O
and O
a O
Javascript B-MISC
(JS) O
dropper O
. O

As O
explained O
in O
further O
detail O
below O
, O
the O
JS B-ORG
dropper O
ultimately O
installs O
a O
JS O
decryptor O
onto O
an O
infected O
machine O
that O
will O
then O
finally O
decrypt O
and O
execute O
the O
actual O
KopiLuwak B-LOC
backdoor O
in O
memory O
only O
. O

As O
Proofpoint B-ORG
has O
not O
yet O
observed O
this O
attack O
in O
the O
wild O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
there O
is O
an O
additional O
component O
that O
leads O
to O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
MSIL B-ORG
payload O
. O

The O
newer O
variant O
of O
KopiLuwak B-ORG
is O
now O
capable O
of O
exfiltrating O
files O
to O
the O
C&C O
as O
well O
as O
downloading O
files O
and O
saving O
them O
to O
the O
infected O
machine O
. O

Despite O
the O
added O
capabilities O
, O
we O
still O
agree O
with O
Kaspersky B-PER
that O
this O
backdoor O
is O
likely O
used O
as O
an O
initial O
reconnaissance O
tool O
and O
would O
probably O
be O
used O
as O
a O
staging O
point O
to O
deploy O
one O

APT41 B-MISC
is O
unique O
among O
tracked O
China-based B-MISC
actors O
in O
that O
it O
leverages O
non-public O
malware O
typically O
reserved O
for O
espionage O
campaigns O
in O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
activity O
for O
personal O
gain O
. O

During O
multiple O
engagements O
, O
APT41 B-ORG
attempted O
to O
remove O
evidence O
of O
some O
of O
its O
activity O
by O
deleting O
Bash B-MISC
histories O
, O
clearing O
Windows B-MISC
security O
and O
system O

, O
and O
modifying O

. O

Explicit O
financially-motivated O
targeting O
is O
unusual O
among O
Chinese B-MISC
statesponsored O
threat O
groups O
, O
and O
evidence O
suggests O
APT41 B-ORG
has O
conducted O
simultaneous O
cyber O
crime O
and O
cyber O
espionage O
operations O
from O
2014 O
onward O
. O

APT41 O
operations O
against O
higher O
education O
, O
travel O
services O
, O
and O
news/media O
firms O
provide O
some O
indication O
that O
the O
group O
also O
tracks O
individuals O
and O
conducts O
surveillance O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
group O
has O
repeatedly O
targeted O
call O
record O
information O
at O
telecom O
companies O
. O

APT41 B-ORG
has O
established O
and O
maintained O
strategic O
access O
to O
organizations O
in O
the O
healthcare O
, O
high-tech O
, O
and O
telecommunications O
sectors O
. O

The O
group’s O
financially O
motivated O
activity O
has O
primarily O
focused O
on O
the O
video O
game O
industry O
, O
where O
APT41 B-ORG
has O
manipulated O
virtual O
currencies O
and O
even O
attempted O
to O
deploy O
ransomware O
. O

In O
another O
instance O
, O
APT41 B-ORG
targeted O
a O
hotel’s O
reservation O
systems O
ahead O
of O
Chinese B-MISC
officials O
staying O
there O
, O
suggesting O
the O
group O
was O
tasked O
to O
reconnoiter O
the O
facility O
for O
security O
reasons O
. O

These O
supply O
chain O
compromise O
tactics O
have O
also O
been O
characteristic O
of O
APT41’s B-ORG
best O
known O
and O
most O
recent O
espionage O
campaigns O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
despite O
the O
significant O
effort O
required O
to O
execute O
supply O
chain O
compromises O
and O
the O
large O
number O
of O
affected O
organizations O
, O
APT41 B-ORG
limits O
the O
deployment O
of O
follow-on O
malware O
to O
specific O
victim O
systems O
by O
matching O
against O
individual O
system O
identifiers O
. O

Mapping O
the O
group’s O
activities O
since O
2012 O
(Figure O
2) O
also O
provides O
some O
indication O
that O
APT41 B-ORG
primarily O
conducts O
financially O
motivated O
operations O
outside O
of O
their O
normal O
day O
jobs O
. O

The O
latter O
is O
especially O
notable O
because O
APT41 B-ORG
has O
repeatedly O
returned O
to O
targeting O
the O
video O
game O
industry O
and O
we O
believe O
these O
activities O
were O
formative O
in O
the O
group’s O
later O
espionage O
operations O
. O

APT41 B-ORG
leverages O
an O
arsenal O
of O
over O
46 O
different O
malware O
families O
and O
tools O
to O
accomplish O
their O
missions O
, O
including O
publicly O
available O
utilities O
, O
malware O
shared O
with O
other O
Chinese B-MISC
espionage O
operations O
, O
and O
tools O
unique O
to O
the O
group O
. O

Once O
in O
a O
victim O
organization O
, O
APT41 B-ORG
can O
leverage O
more O
sophisticated O
TTPs B-MISC
and O
deploy O
additional O
malware O
. O

APT41 O
often O
relies O
on O
spear-phishing O
emails O
with O
attachments O
such O
as O
compiled O
HTML O
(.chm) O
files O
to O
initially O
compromise O
their O
victims O
. O

APT41 B-ORG
has O
also O
deployed O
rootkits O
and O
Master O
Boot O
Record O
(MBR) O
bootkits O
on O
a O
limited O
basis O
to O
hide O
their O
malware O
and O
maintain O
persistence O
on O
select O
victim O
systems O
. O

The O
limited O
use O
of O
these O
tools O
by O
APT41 B-ORG
suggests O
the O
group O
reserves O
more O
advanced O
TTPs B-MISC
and O
malware O
only O
for O
high-value O
targets O
. O

Like O
other O
Chinese B-MISC
espionage O
operators O
, O
APT41 B-ORG
appears O
to O
have O
moved O
toward O
strategic O
intelligence O
collection O
and O
establishing O
access O
and O
away O
from O
direct O
intellectual O
property O
theft O
since O
2015 O
. O

This O
shift O
, O
however O
, O
has O
not O
affected O
the O
group's O
consistent O
interest O
in O
targeting O
the O
video O
game O
industry O
for O
financially O
motivated O
reasons O
. O

In O

, O
several O

Based O
on O
the O
functionality O
of O
the O
various O
tools O
uploaded O
to O
the O
webshells O
, O
we O
believe O
the O
threat O
actors O
breach O
the O
SharePoint B-MISC
servers O
to O
use O
as O
a O
beachhead O
, O
then O
attempt O
to O
move O
laterally O
across O
the O
network O
via O
stolen O

and O
exploiting O

. O

We O
also O
observed O
the O
actors O
uploading O
custom O
backdoors O
such O
as O
HyperBro B-MISC
which O
is O
commonly O
associated O
with O
Emissary B-ORG
Panda I-ORG

Both O
of O
these O
alerts O
discussed O
campaigns O
in O
which O
actors O
used O
the O
CVE-2019-0604 B-MISC
to O
exploit O
SharePoint B-MISC
servers O
to O
install O
the O
China B-MISC
Chopper I-MISC
webshell O
. O

During O
our O
research O
into O
this O
attack O
campaign O
, O
Unit B-ORG
42 I-ORG
gathered O
several O
tools O
that O
the O
Emissary B-ORG
Panda I-ORG
uploaded O
to O
the O
three O
webshells O
at O
the O
two O
government O
organizations O
. O

We O
also O
observed O
the O
actors O
uploading O
the O
HyperBro O
backdoor O
to O
one O
of O
the O
webshells O
, O
as O
well O
as O
legitimate O

that O
would O
sideload O
malicious O
DLLs O
that O
have O
overlapping O
code O
associated O
with O
known O
Emissary B-MISC
Panda I-MISC
activity O
. O

Lastly O
, O
we O
saw O
the O
actor O
uploading O
a O
custom O
backdoor O
called O
HyperBro B-MISC
, I-MISC
which O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
Emissary B-ORG
Panda I-ORG
operations O
in O
the O
past O
. O

The O
other O
overlapping O

are O
tools O
used O
by O
the O
adversary O
to O
locate O
other O

on O
the O
network O
(etool.exe) O
, O
check O

if O
they O
are O
vulnerable O
to O
CVE-2017-0144 B-MISC

in O
MS07-010 O
(checker1.exe) O
and O
pivot O
to O
them O
using O
remote O

functionality O
offered O
by O
a O

similar O
to O
PsExec B-ORG
offered O
by O
Impacket B-ORG
(psexec.exe) O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
NCSC B-ORG
advisory O
mentioned O
that O
the O
actors O
used O
a O
file O
name O
stylecss.aspx O
for O
their O
webshell O
, O
which O
is O
the O
same O
filename O
we O
saw O
associated O
with O
China B-ORG
Chopper I-ORG
. I-ORG

We O
will O
provide O
an O
analysis O
of O
the O
HyperBro B-MISC
tool O
in O
an O
upcoming O
section O
. O

However O
, O
using O
NCC B-ORG
Group’s I-ORG
research O
published O
in O
May O
2018 O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
discover O
code O
overlaps O
between O
these O
DLLs O
and O
a O
sideloaded O
DLL B-MISC
that O
ran O
the O
SysUpdate B-MISC
tool O
that O
the O
NCC B-ORG
group O
has O
associated O
with O
an O
Emissary B-ORG
Panda I-ORG
campaign O
. O

The O
list O
also O
includes O
several O
hack O
tools O
, O
such O
as O
Mimikatz B-MISC
for O
credential O
dumping O
and O
several O
compiled O
python O
scripts O
used O
to O
locate O
and O
compromise O
other O
systems O
on O
the O
local O
network O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
we O
do O
not O
have O
access O
to O
the O
PYTHON33.hlp B-MISC
or O
CreateTsMediaAdm.hlp B-MISC
files O
, O
so O
we O
do O
not O
know O
the O
final O
payload O
loaded O
by O
either O
of O
these O
DLLs O
. O

Figure O

was O
sideloaded O
to O

The O
Emissary B-ORG

group O
loaded O
the O

at O
two O
Government O
organizations O
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
, I-LOC
which O
we O
believe O
with O
high O
confidence O
involved O
exploiting O
a O
remote O
code O
execution O
vulnerability O
in O
SharePoint B-MISC
tracked O
in O
CVE-2019-0604 O
. O

The O

scan O
remote O

to O
CVE-2017-0144 B-MISC
(EternalBlue) B-MISC
that O
we O
saw O
uploaded O
to O
the O
other O
errr.aspx O
webshell O

According O
to O
Microsoft’s B-ORG
advisory O
, O
this O
vulnerability O
was O
patched O
on O
March O
12 O
, O
2019 O
and O
we O
first O
saw O
the O
webshell O
activity O
on O
April O
1 O
, O
2019 O
. O

We O
believe O
the O
actors O
pivoted O
to O
other O
systems O
on O
the O
network O
using O
stolen O
credentials O
and O
by O
exploiting O
the O
CVE-2017-0144 O

patched O
in O
MS17-010 O
. O

Once O
the O
adversary O
established O
a O
foothold O
on O
the O
targeted O
network O
, O
they O
used O
China B-ORG
Chopper I-ORG
and O
other O
webshells O
to O
upload O
additional O
tools O
to O
the O
SharePoint B-MISC
server O
to O
dump O

, O
perform O
network O
reconnaissance O
and O
pivot O
to O
other O

We O
also O
observed O
Emissary B-ORG

following O
some O

the O
FIN7 B-ORG

The O

this O

that O
a O
much O
more O
holistic O
approach—one O

rather O

This O
is O
a O
first O
for O

Three O

At O
the O
end O
of O
August O
2018 O
, O
the O
Sednit B-ORG

launched O
a O
spearphishing O

where O
it O
distributed O

On O

that O

Turla B-LOC
is O
believed O

operating O
since O
at O

2008 O
, O
when O
it O
successfully O

This O
is O

the O

Turla B-ORG
has O
used O

increase O
its O

This O
new O

our O

and O
shows O
that O
the O
Turla B-ORG

does O
not O
hesitate O
to O
use O

to O
conduct O

One O
attack O
during O
this O

involved O
the O
use O

another O

group O
known O
as O
Crambus B-ORG

Waterbug B-ORG
has O
been O
using O

since O
at O

early O

and O
, O
in O
this O

, O
used O
a O

which O
was O
encoded O
and O
given O
a O
.wav O

in O

to O

true O
purpose O
. O

In O
all O
likelihood O
, O
Waterbug’s B-ORG
use O
of O
Crambus B-ORG
infrastructure O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
a O
hostile O
takeover O
. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
interesting O
things O
to O
occur O
during O
one O
of O
Waterbug’s B-ORG
recent O
campaigns O
was O
that O
during O
an O
attack O
against O
one O
target O
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
, I-LOC
Waterbug B-ORG
appeared O
to O
hijack O
infrastructure O
from O
the O
Crambus B-MISC
espionage O
group O
and O
used O
it O
to O
deliver O
malware O
on O
to O
the O
victim’s O
network O
. O

These O
three O
recent O
Waterbug B-MISC
campaigns O
have O
seen O
the O
group O
compromise O
governments O
and O
international O
organizations O
across O
the O
globe O
in O
addition O
to O
targets O
in O
the O
IT B-ORG
and O
education O
sectors O
. O

Curiously O
though O
, O
Waterbug B-ORG
also O
compromised O
other O
computers O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
using O
its O
own O
infrastructure O
. O

Symantec B-ORG
believes O
that O
the O
variant O
of O
Mimikatz B-MISC
used O
in O
this O
attack O
is O
unique O
to O
Waterbug B-ORG
. I-ORG

Aside O
from O
the O
attack O
involving O
Crambus B-MISC
infrastructure O
, O
this O
sample O
of O
Mimikatz B-MISC
has O
only O
been O
seen O
used O
in O
one O
other O
attack O
, O
against O
an O
education O
target O
in O
the O
UK B-LOC
in O
2017 O
. O

The O
first O
observed O
evidence O
of O
Waterbug B-MISC
activity O
came O
on O
January O
11 O
, O
2018 O
, O
when O
a O
Waterbug-linked B-MISC
tool O
(a O
task O
scheduler O
named O
msfgi.exe) B-MISC
was O
dropped O
on O
to O
a O
computer O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
attack O
against O
the O
Middle B-MISC
Eastern I-MISC
target O
, O
Crambus B-PER
was O
the O
first O
group O
to O
compromise O
the O
victim’s O
network O
, O
with O
the O
earliest O
evidence O
of O
activity O
dating O
to O
November O
2017 O
. O

Waterbug’s O
intrusions O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
continued O
for O
much O
of O
2018 O
. O

Symantec B-ORG

not O

observed O
activity O
on O
the O
victim’s O
network O
and O
its O
observed O
use O
of O
Crambus B-MISC
infrastructure O
suggests O
that O
Waterbug B-ORG
may O
have O
used O
the O
Crambus B-MISC
infrastructure O
as O
an O
initial O
access O
point. O
It O
also O
reconfigures O
the O
Microsoft B-MISC
Sysinternals I-MISC

to O
prevent O
pop-ups O

running O
the O
PsExec B-ORG

Waterbug B-ORG
also O
used O
an O
older O
version O
of O

, I-ORG
likely O
to O
avoid O
logging O
. O

In O
one O
of O

a O

However O
, O
Brazilian B-MISC

, O
such O
as O

we O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O
the O

The O

Like O
many O

, O
much O
of O
APT40 B-ORG

activity O
begins O
by O
attempting O
to O
trick O
targets O
with O
phishing O
emails O
, O
before O
deploying O
malware O
such O
as O
the O
Gh0st B-MISC

trojan O
to O
maintain O
persistence O
on O
a O
compromised O
network O

The O
group O

of O
an O

manages O
the O
company O

companies O
. O

We O
suspect O
that O
the O
group O
sought O
access O
to O
these O

to O
obtain O
information O
that O
would O
enable O
it O
to O
monitor O

Bahamut B-PER
was O
shown O
to O
be O
resourceful O
, O
not O
only O
maintaining O
their O
own O
Android B-MISC
malware O
but O
running O
propaganda O
sites O
, O
although O
the O
quality O
of O
these O
activities O
varied O
noticeably O
. O

One O
curious O
trait O
of O
Bahamut B-MISC
is O
that O
it O
develops O
fully-functional O
applications O
in O
support O
of O
its O
espionage O
activities O
, O
rather O
than O
push O
nonfunctional O
fake O
apps O
or O
bundle O

with O
legitimate O
software O
. O

Curiously O
, O
Bahamut B-PER
appears O
to O
track O

attempts O
in O
response O
to O
failed O

attempts O
or O
to O
provoke O
the O

more O

Thus O
far O
, O
Bahamut B-PER
