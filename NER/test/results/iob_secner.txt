The O

Based O
on O
this O

we O
believe O
the O

were O
targeting O
political B-IDTY
entities I-IDTY

Additionally O

these O

That O
this O

is O
apparent O
from O
the O

the O
tactics O

techniques O

procedures O
(TTPs) O
of O
a O
Brazilian O
cyber O
crime O
group O
that O
specializes O
in O
payment O
card O
fraud O
operations O
. O

The O
threat O
actors B-APT
, I-APT
observed O
by O
FireEye B-SECTEAM
Labs O
, O
use O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise O
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
, O
including O
sharing O
or O
purchasing O
dumps O
online O
, O
hacking O
vulnerable O
merchant O
websites O
and O
compromising O
payment O
card O
processing O
devices O
. O

Once O
in O
their O
possession O
, O
the O
actors O
use O
these O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
to O
generate O
further O
card O
information O
. O

The O
members O
of O
the O
group O
use O
a O
variety O
of O
tools O
, O
including O
CCleaner B-MAL
, I-MAL
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
to O
effectively O
remove O
any O
evidence O
of O
their O
operations O
. O

Another O
common O
step O
taken O
by O
threat O
actors O
is O
changing O
their O
system's O
MAC O
Address O
to O
avoid O
being O
uniquely O
identified O
. O

For O
this O
purpose O
, O
these O
actors B-APT
often O
use O
tools O
such O
as O
Technitium B-TOOL
MAC I-TOOL
Address I-TOOL

. I-TOOL

We O
have O
observed O
these O
actors B-APT
using O
Tor O

similar O
to O
Tor O
(e.g O
, O
UltraSurf B-MAL
, I-MAL
as O
seen O
in O
Figure O

. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
them B-FILE
using O
virtual O
private O
network O
services O
that O
use O
IPs O
based O
in O
numerous O
countries O
to O
ensure O
anonymity O
and O
obfuscate O
criminal O
operations O

Based O
on O
our O
observations O
, O
this O
group O
uses O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise O
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
. O

Payment O
card O

are O
commonly O

via O
social O

forums O
such O
as O
Facebook O
, O
Skype O
, O
and O
web-based O
WhatsApp B-TOOL
messenger O

Similarly O
, O
the O
group O
takes O
advantage O
of O
freely O
available O
consolidations O
of O
email B-TOOL
credentials O
, O
personal O
information O
, O
and O
other O
data O
shared O
in O
eCrime O
forums O
for O
fraud O
purposes O
. O

These O
actors B-APT
scan O
websites O
for O
vulnerabilities O
to O
exploit B-VULNAME
to O
illicitly O
access O
databases O
. O

They O
most O
commonly O
target O

Once O

these O

have O
discovered O
that O
this O
attack O
group O
, O
which O
we O
call O
Whitefly B-APT
, I-APT
has O
been O
operating O
since O
at O
least O
2017 B-TIME
, I-TIME
has O
targeted O
organizations O
based O
mostly O
in O
Singapore B-LOC
across O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
sectors O
, O
and O
is O
primarily O
interested O
in O
stealing O
large O
amounts O
of O
sensitive O
information O
. O

Whitefly B-APT
compromises O
its O

using O
custom O

and O
living B-ACT

From O
mid-2017 B-TIME
to O
mid-2018 B-TIME
, I-TIME
Whitefly B-APT
launched O
targeted B-ACT
attacks I-ACT
against O
multiple O
organizations O
. O

While O
most O
of O
these O
organizations O
were O
based O
in O
Singapore B-LOC
, I-LOC
some O
were O
multinational O
organizations O
with O
a O
presence O
in O
Singapore B-LOC
. I-LOC

To O
date O
, O
Whitefly B-APT
has O
attacked O
organizations O
in O
the O
healthcare B-IDTY
, I-IDTY
media I-IDTY
, I-IDTY
telecommunications I-IDTY
, I-IDTY
and O
engineering B-IDTY
sectors I-IDTY
. I-IDTY

Whitefly B-APT
first O
infects O
its O
victims O
using O
a O
dropper B-MAL
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
malicious.exe B-FILE
or O
.dll B-FILE
file I-FILE
that O
is O
disguised O
as O
a O
document O
or O
image O
. O

If O
opened O
, O
the O
dropper O
runs O
a O
loader O
known O
as O
Trojan.Vcrodat B-FILE
on O
the O
computer O
. O

Whitefly B-APT
has O
consistently O
used O
a O
technique O
known O
as O
search B-ACT
order I-ACT
hijacking I-ACT
to O
run O
Vcrodat B-MAL
. I-MAL

Once O
executed O
, O
Vcrodat B-MAL
loads O
an O
encrypted O
payload O
on O
to O
the O
victim O
's O
computer O
. O

Whitefly B-APT
rely O
heavily O
on O
tools O
such O
as O
Mimikatz B-MAL
to O
obtain O
credentials O
. O

Using O
these O
credentials O
, O
the O
attackers O
are O
able O
to O
compromise O
more O
machines O
on O
the O
network O
and O
, O
from O
those O
machines O
, O
again O
obtain O
more O
credentials O
. O

Whitefly B-APT
usually O
attempts O
to O
remain O
within O
a O
targeted O
organization O
for O
long O
periods O
of O
time—often O
months—in O
order O
to O
steal O
large O
volumes O
of O
information O
. O

In O
order O
to O
carry O
out O
this O
operation O
, O
it O
uses O
publicly B-MAL
available I-MAL
tools I-MAL
, I-MAL
including O
Mimikatz B-MAL
( O
Hacktool.Mimikatz O
) O
and O
an O
open-source O
tool O
that O
exploits O
a O
known O
Windows B-OS
privilege O

( O
CVE-2016-0051 O
) O
on O
unpatched O

Like O
Vcrodat B-MAL
, I-MAL
Nibatad B-FILE
is O
also O
a O
loader O
that O
leverages O
search O
order O
hijacking O
, O
and O
downloads O
an O
encrypted O
payload O
to O
the O
infected O
computer O
. O

Why O
Whitefly B-APT
uses O
these O
two O
different O
loaders O
in O
some O
of O
its O
attacks O
remains O
unknown O
. O

While O
Vcrodat B-MAL
is O
delivered O
via O
the O
malicious O

, O
we O
have O
yet O
to O

how O
Nibatad B-MAL

We O
believe O
that O
the O

is O
a O
clear O
indicator O
of O
a O
new O

in O

in O

directly O
against O
the O

instead O
of O

. I-IDTY

Carbanak B-MAL
has O
its O
origin O
in O
more O
common O
financial O

including O

However O
, O
in O
September B-TIME
last O

, O
our O

a O

detailing O
a O
new O
Carbanak B-MAL
variant O
affecting O
one O
of O
its O

. I-IDTY

Alternatively O
, O
it O
is O
also O
possible O
that O
APT41 B-APT
injected B-ACT
malicious I-ACT

into O
the O

circumventing O
the O

In O
these O
instances O
, O
APT41 B-APT
leveraged O

to O
transfer O

, O
although O
we O
do O
not O
have O

In O
some O

The O
Dukes B-APT
are O
known O
to O
employ O
a O
vast O
arsenal O
of O
malware O
toolsets O
, O
which O
we O
identify O
as O
MiniDuke B-MAL

PinchDuke I-MAL
, I-MAL
and O
GeminiDuke B-MAL
. I-MAL

The O
origins O
of O
the O
Duke O
toolset O
names O
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
when O
researchers O
at O
Kaspersky B-SECTEAM
Labs I-SECTEAM
coined O
the O
term O
" O
MiniDuke B-MAL
" O
to O
identify O
the O
first O
Duke-related B-MAL
malware I-MAL
they O
found O
. O

As O
researchers O
continued O
discovering O
new O
toolsets O
that O
were O
created O
and O
used O
by O
the O
same O
group O
that O
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke B-MAL
, I-MAL
and O
thus O
the O
threat O
actor O
operating O
the O
toolsets O
started O
to O
be O
commonly O
referred O
to O
as O
" O
Dukes B-APT
" O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
campaign O
identifiers O
found O
in O
PinchDuke B-MAL
samples I-MAL
discovered O
from O
2009 B-TIME
, I-TIME
the O
targets O
of O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group I-APT
during O
that O
year O
included O
organizations O
such O
as O
the O
Ministry B-IDTY
of I-IDTY
Defense I-IDTY
of O

and O
the O
ministries B-IDTY
of I-IDTY
foreign I-IDTY

of O
Turkey B-LOC
and O
Uganda B-LOC
. I-LOC

Importantly O
, O
PinchDuke B-MAL
trojan I-MAL
samples I-MAL
always O
contain O
a O
notable O
text O
string O
, O
which O
we O
believe O
is O
used O
as O
a O
campaign O
identifier O
by O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group I-APT
to O
distinguish O
between O
multiple O
attack B-ACT
campaigns I-ACT
that O
are O
run O
in O
parallel O
. O

This O
neatly O
ties O
together O
many O
of O
the O
tools O
used O
by O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group I-APT
, I-APT
as O
versions O
of O
this O
one O
loader O
have O
been O
used O
to O
load O
malware O
from O
three O
different O
Dukes-related O
toolsets O
CosmicDuke B-MAL
, I-MAL
PinchDuke I-MAL
, I-MAL
and O
MiniDuke B-MAL
– O
over O
the O
course O
of O
five O
years O
. O

The O
Dukes B-APT
continued O
the O
expansion O
of O
their O
arsenal O
in O
2011 B-TIME
with O
the O
addition O
of O
two O
more O
toolsets O
: O
MiniDuke B-MAL
and O
CozyDuke B-MAL
. I-MAL

As O
we O
now O
know O
, O
by O
February B-TIME
2013 I-TIME
the O
Dukes B-APT
group I-APT
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke B-MAL
and O
other O
toolsets O
for O
at O
least O
4 O
and O
a O
half O
years O
. O

Secondly O
, O
the O
value O
the O
Dukes B-APT
intended O
to O
gain O
from O
these O
MiniDuke B-ACT
campaigns I-ACT
may O
have O
been O
so O
great O
that O
they O
deemed O
it O
worth O
the O
risk O
of O
getting O
noticed O
. O

This O
is O
in O
stark O
contrast O
to O
some O
other O
suspected O
Russian B-LOC
threat O
actors B-APT
( O
such O
as O
Operation B-ACT
Pawn I-ACT
Storm I-ACT
) I-ACT
who O
appear O
to O
have O
increased O
their O
targeting O
of O
Ukraine B-LOC
following O
the O
crisis O
. O

The O
Dukes B-APT
actively O
targeted O
Ukraine B-LOC
before O
the O
crisis O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
Russia B-LOC
was O
still O
weighing O
her O
options O
, O
but O
once O
Russia B-LOC
moved O
from O
diplomacy O
to O
direct O
action O
, O
Ukraine B-LOC
was O
no O
longer O
relevant O
to O
the O
Dukes B-APT
in O
the O
same O
way O
. O

In O
the O
latter O
case O
however O
, O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group I-APT
appear O
to O
have O
also O
simultaneously O
developed O
an O
entirely O
new O
loader O
, O
which O
we O
first O
observed O
being O
used O
in O
conjunction O
with O
CosmicDuke B-MAL
during O
the O
spring B-TIME
of I-TIME
2015 I-TIME
. I-TIME

The O
Dukes B-APT
could O
have O
ceased O
all O
use O
of O
CosmicDuke B-MAL
( O
at O
least O
until O
they O
had O
developed O
a O
new O
loader O
) O
or O
retired O
it O
entirely O
, O
since O
they O
still O
had O
other O
toolsets O
available O
. O

For O
these O
CozyDuke B-ACT
campaigns I-ACT
however O
, O
the O
Dukes B-APT
appear O
to O
have O
employed O
two O
particular O
later-stage O
toolsets O
, O
SeaDuke B-MAL
and O
HammerDuke B-MAL
. I-MAL

Firstly O
, O
as O
with O
the O
MiniDuke B-ACT
campaigns I-ACT
of O
February B-TIME
2013 I-TIME
and O
CosmicDuke B-ACT
campaigns I-ACT
in O
the O
summer B-TIME
of I-TIME
2014 I-TIME
, I-TIME
again O
the O
group O
clearly O
prioritized O
the O
continuation O
of O
their O
operations O
over O
maintaining O
stealth O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
notably O
overt O
and O
large-scale O
campaigns B-ACT
with O
CozyDuke B-ACT
and O
CloudDuke B-ACT
, I-ACT
the O
Dukes B-APT
also O
continued O
to O
engage O
in O
more O
covert O
, O
surgical O
campaigns B-ACT
using O
CosmicDuke B-MAL
. I-MAL

We O
are O
however O
only O
aware O
of O
one O
instance O
- O
the O
exploitation O
of O
CVE-2013-0640 B-VULID
to O
deploy O
MiniDuke B-MAL
- O
where O
we O
believe O
the O
exploited O
vulnerability O
was O
a O
zero-day B-VULNAME
at O
the O
time O
that O
the O
group O
acquired O
the O
exploit B-VULNAME
. I-VULNAME

All O
of O
the O
available O
evidence O
however O
does O
in O
our O
opinion O
suggest O
that O
the O
group O
operates O
on O

of O
the O
Russian B-LOC

. O

This O
assertion O
of O
time O

is O
also O
supported O
by O

in O
many O

similarly O
suggest O
the O

In O

we O
judge O
that O

manipulating O

entities I-IDTY
since O
at O

We O
surmise O
that O
the O

APT38 B-APT
also O
targeted O

APT38 B-APT

It O
is O
highly O

that O
this O

we O
urge O

of O
the O
Metel B-MAL

A O
second O
group O
, O
which O
we O
call O
GCMAN B-APT
because O
the O
malware O
is O
based O
on O
code O
compiled O
on O
the O
GCC O
compiler O
, O
emerged O
recently O
using O
similar O
techniques O
to O
the O
Metel B-APT

to O
infect O

institutions I-IDTY
and O
attempt O
to O

Our O

Our O

revealed O
an O

where O
the O
GCMAN B-APT
group I-APT
then O
planted O
a O

The O
GCMAN B-APT
group I-APT
used O
an O

running O
on O
one O

about O

a O

three O

it O
was O
not O
obvious O
whether O

the O
one O
responsible O
for O
the O
fraudulent O

if O

in O

We O
would O
like O
to O
add O
some O
strong O
facts O
that O
link O
some O
attacks O
on O
banks B-IDTY
to O
Lazarus B-APT
, I-APT
and O
share O
some O
of O
our O
own O
findings O
as O
well O
as O
shed O
some O

on O

Lazarus B-ACT
attacks I-ACT
are O
not O
a O
local O
problem O
and O
clearly O
the O
group O
's O
operations O
span O
across O
the O
whole O
world O
. O

Lazarus B-APT
was O
previously O
known O
to O
conduct O
cyberespionage B-ACT
and I-ACT
cybersabotage I-ACT
activities I-ACT
, I-ACT
such O
as O
attacks O
on O
Sony B-IDTY

with O
volumes O
of O
internal O
data O
leaked O
, O
and O
many O
system O

in O
the O

wiped O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Lazarus B-APT
Group I-APT
is O
very O
large O
and O
works O
mainly O
on O
infiltration O
and O
espionage B-ACT
operations I-ACT
, I-ACT
while O
a O
substantially O
smaller O
units O
within O
the O
group O
, O
which O
we O
have O
dubbed O
Bluenoroff B-APT
, I-APT
is O
responsible O
for O
financial O
profit O
. O

Lazarus B-APT
regrouped O
and O
rushed O
into O
new O
countries O
, O
selecting O
mostly O
poorer O
and O
less O
developed O
locations O
, O
hitting O
smaller O
banks B-IDTY
because O
they O
are O
, O
apparently O
, O
easy O
prey O
. O

To O
date O
, O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
group I-APT
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
most O
successful O
in O
launching O
large O
scale O
operations O
against O
the O
financial B-IDTY
industry I-IDTY
. I-IDTY

We O
believe O
that O
Lazarus B-APT
will O
remain O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
threats O
to O
the O
banking B-IDTY
sector I-IDTY
, I-IDTY

as O

We O
believe O
Lazarus B-APT
started O
this O

at O
the O
end B-TIME
of I-TIME

A O
rudimentary O
but O
somewhat O
clever O
design O
, O
KiloAlfa B-MAL
provides O
keylogging O
capability O
for O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group I-APT
's I-APT
collection O
of O
malicious O
tools O
. O

The O
design O
of O
KiloAlfa B-MAL
is O
broken O
down O
into O
two O
basic O
components O
: O
the O
persistence O
functionality O
and O
the O
keylogging B-MAL
functionality I-MAL
. I-MAL

The O
persistence O
functionality O
of O
KiloAlfa B-MAL
allows O
the O
malware O
to O
self-install O
on O
a O
victim O
's O
machine O
when O
activated O
( O
described O
below O
) O
. O

Evidence O
suggest O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group I-APT
uses O
compromised B-MAL
infrastructure I-MAL
as O
the O
public-facing O
touchpoint O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
their O
malware O
samples O
. O

PapaAlfa B-MAL
is O
believed O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
proxy O
malware O
components O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group I-APT
uses O
to O
hide O
the O
true O
command O
and O
control O
server O
( O
s O
) O
for O
operations O
. O

Rather O
, O
PapaAlfa B-MAL
could O
be O
considered O
a O
smart O
proxy O
due O
in O
part O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
can O
easily O
switch O
the O
backend O
destination O
address O
and O
port O
without O
having O
to O
reestablish O
control O
over O
the O
infected O
machine O
hosting O
the O
PapaAlfa B-MAL
malware I-MAL
. I-MAL

In O
terms O
of O
form O
factor O
, O
PapaAlfa B-MAL
comes O
in O
two O
flavors O
: O
service B-MAL
DLL I-MAL
and O
standalone B-MAL
executable I-MAL
. I-MAL

The O
IndiaBravo-PapaAlfa B-MAL

cyber O

making O
them O
inherently O

often O
lay O
the O

APT10 B-APT
withdrew O

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
that O
this O
is O
due O
to O
the O
release O
of O
the O

Our O
report O
will O
detail O
the O
most O
recent O
campaigns B-ACT
conducted O
by O
APT10 B-APT
, I-APT
including O
the O
sustained O
targeting O
of O
MSPs B-IDTY
, I-IDTY
which O
we O
have O
named O
Operation B-ACT
Cloud I-ACT
Hopper I-ACT
, I-ACT
and O
the O
targeting O
of O
a O
number O
of O
Japanese B-LOC
institutions B-IDTY
. I-IDTY

MSPs B-IDTY
therefore O
represent O
a O
high-payoff O
target O
for O
espionagefocused O
threat O
actors B-APT
such O
as O
APT10 B-APT
. I-APT

Given O
the O
level O
of O
client O

access O
MSPs B-IDTY
have O
, O
once O
APT10 B-APT
has O
gained O
access O
to O
a O
MSP B-MAL
, I-MAL
it O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
relatively O
straightforward O
to O
exploit B-VULNAME
this O
and O
move O
laterally O
onto O
the O
networks O
of O
potentially O
thousands O
of O
other O
victims O
. O

This O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
would O
provide O
access O
to O
a O
larger O
amount O
of O
intellectual O
property O
and O
sensitive O
data O
. O

APT10 B-APT
has O
been O
observed O
to O
exfiltrate O
stolen O
intellectual O
property O
via O
the O
MSPs B-IDTY
, I-IDTY
hence O
evading O
local O

( B-TOOL

infrastructure O
chosen O
by O

for O
Operation B-ACT

predominantly O

Several O
of O
these O

APT10 B-APT
are O
almost O

The O
13th O

the O

are O
broadly O
in O
line O
with O
the O
strategic O
aims O
documented O
in O
this O

These O
aims O
outlined O
in O
the O

will O
largely O
dictate O
the O

APT10 B-APT
has O
, O
in O
the O

primarily O
been O
known O
for O
its O
targeting O
of O

Observed O
APT10 B-APT

in O

with O
many O
of O
the O
historic O

we O
have O
outlined O
previously O
as O
originating O
from O
China B-LOC
. I-LOC

In O
line O
with O
commonly O
used O
APT B-APT
actor I-APT
methodologies O
, O
the O
threat O
actor O
aligns O
its O
decoy B-MAL
documents I-MAL
to O
a O

This O
section O
details O
changes O
made O
to O
APT10 B-APT
tools O
, O
techniques O
and O
procedures O
( O
TTPs O
) O
post-2014 B-TIME
, I-TIME
following O
its O
shift O
from O
Poison B-MAL
Ivy I-MAL
to O
PlugX B-MAL
. I-MAL

We O
have O
observed O
that O
in O
cases O
where O
APT10 B-APT
has O
infiltrated O
a O
target O
via O
an O
MSP B-MAL
, I-MAL
it O
continues O
to O
use O
the O
MSPs B-IDTY
credentials O
. O

In O
order O
to O
gain O
any O
further O
credentials O
, O
APT10 B-APT
will O
usually O
deploy O
credential O
theft O
tools O
such O
as O
mimikatz B-MAL
or O
PwDump B-MAL
, I-MAL
sometimes O
using O
DLL B-MAL
load I-MAL
order I-MAL
hijacking I-MAL
, I-MAL
to O
use O
against O
a O
domain O
controller O
, O
explained O
further O
in O
Annex O
B O
. O

APT10 B-APT
achieves O
persistence O
on O
its O
targets O
primarily O
by O
using O
scheduled B-MAL
tasks I-MAL
or O
Windows B-MAL
services I-MAL
in O
order O
to O
ensure O
the O
malware O
remains O
active O
regardless O
of O
system O
reboots O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
compromising O
high O
value O
domain O
controllers O
and O
security O
servers O
, O
the O
threat O
actor O
has O
also O
been O
observed O
identifying O
and O
subsequently O
installing O
malware O
on O
low O
profile O
systems O
that O
provide O
non-critical O
support O
functions O
to O
the O
business O
, O
and O
are O
thus O
less O
likely O
to O
draw O
the O
attention O
of O
system O
administrators O
. O

In O
the O
majority O
of O
instances O
APT10 B-APT
used O
either O
a O
reverse B-MAL
shell I-MAL
or O
RDP B-MAL
connection O
to O
install O
its O
malware O
; O
the O
actor B-APT
also O
uses O
these O
methods O
to O
propagate O
across O
the O
network O
. O

The O
tactical O
malware O
, O
historically O
EvilGrab B-MAL
, I-MAL
and O
now O
ChChes B-MAL
( O
and O
likely O
also O
RedLeaves B-MAL
) I-MAL
, I-MAL
is O
designed O
to O
be O
lightweight O
and O
disposable O
, O
often O
being O
delivered O
through O
spear B-ACT
phishing I-ACT
. I-ACT

Once O
executed O
, O
tactical O
malware O
contains O
the O
capability O
to O
profile O
the O
network O
and O
manoeuvre O
through O
it O
to O
identify O
a O
key O
system O
of O
interest O
. O

We O
have O
also O
observed O
APT10 B-APT
use O
DLL B-ACT
search I-ACT
order I-ACT
hijacking I-ACT
and I-ACT
sideloading I-ACT
, I-ACT
to O
execute O
some O
modified O
versions O
of O
open-source O
tools O
. O

For O
example O
, O
PwC B-SECTEAM
UK I-SECTEAM
has O
observed O
APT10 B-APT
compiling O
DLLs O
out O
of O
tools O
, O
such O
as O
Mimikatz B-MAL
and O
PwDump6 B-MAL
, I-MAL
and O
using O
legitimate O
, O
signed O
software O
, O
such O
as O
Windows B-OS
Defender O
to O
load O
the O
malicious O
payloads O
. O

During O
our O
analysis O
of O
victim O
networks O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
observe O
APT10 B-APT
once O
again O
initiate O
a O
retooling O

in O
late B-TIME

We O

The O

We O
suspect O
the O

may O
be O

work O
independently O

APT5 B-APT
has O
targeted O
or O
breached O
organizations O
across O
multiple O
industries O
, O
but O
its O
focus O
appears O
to O
be O
on O
telecommunications B-IDTY
and O
technology B-IDTY
companies I-IDTY
, I-IDTY
especially O
information O
about O
satellite B-IDTY
communications I-IDTY

APT5 B-APT
targeted O
the O
network O
of O
an O
electronics B-IDTY
firm I-IDTY
that O
sells O
products O
for O
both O
industrial B-IDTY
and O
military B-IDTY
applications O
. O

The O
group O
subsequently O
stole O

the O

with O
a O
national O

In O
one O
case O
in O
late B-TIME
2014 I-TIME
, I-TIME
APT5 O
breached O
the O
network O
of O
an O
international B-IDTY
telecommunications I-IDTY
company I-IDTY
. I-IDTY

The O
group O
used O
malware O
with O

to O
monitor O
the O
computer O
of O
an O
executive O
who O
manages O
the O
company O

some O
of O
Southeast O

major O
telecommunications B-IDTY
providers I-IDTY
with O
Leouncia B-MAL

We O
suspect O
that O
the O
group O
sought O
access O
to O
these O

to O
obtain O

Nearly O
a O

later O
, O

are O
now O
shining O
a O
bright O
light O
on O
the O

and O
the O
mysterious O
group O
behind O
the O

. O

The O
attacks O
discussed O
in O
this O

are O
related O
to O
an O
APT B-ACT

referred O
to O

In O
contrast O

many O

which O
tend O
to O
rely O
heavily O
on O

While O
we O

recover O
the O

it O
is O
possibly O
the O

, O
to O

use O
zero-day B-VULNAME

even O

Our O
direct O
observation O
of O
in-the-wild O
spearphishing B-ACT
attacks I-ACT
staged O
by O
the O
Bahamut O

have O
been O
solely O
attempts O

through O
impersonation O
of O

from O

Bahamut O
was O
first O
noticed O
when O
it O
targeted O
a O
Middle B-IDTY

in O
the O
first O
week O
of O
January B-TIME
2017 I-TIME
. I-TIME

Later O
that O
month O
, O
the O
same O
tactics O
and O
patterns O
were O
seen O
in O
attempts O
against O
an O
Iranian B-IDTY
women I-IDTY
's I-IDTY
activist I-IDTY
– O
an O
individual B-IDTY
commonly O
targeted O
by O
Iranian B-LOC
actors I-LOC
, I-LOC
such O
as O
Charming O
Kitten O
and O
the O
Sima B-ACT
campaign I-ACT
documented O
in O
our O
2016 B-TIME
Black O

. O

In O
June B-TIME
we O
published O
on O
a O
previously O
unknown O
group O
we O
named O
" O
Bahamut B-APT
" O
, O
a O
strange O
campaign O
of O
phishing B-ACT

apparently O
focused O
on O
the O
Middle B-LOC

South B-LOC

Once O
inside O
a O
network O
, O
APT40 B-APT
uses O
credential-harvesting B-MAL
tools I-MAL
to O
gain O

, O
allowing O
it O
to O
expand O
its O
reach O
across O

move O
laterally O
through O
an O
environment O
as O
it O
moves O
to O
towards O
the O
ultimate O
goal O
of O
stealing O
data O
. O

Bahamut B-APT
was O
shown O
to O
be O
resourceful O
, O
not O
only O
maintaining O
their O
own O
Android B-OS
malware B-MAL
but O
running O
propaganda O
sites O
, O
although O
the O
quality O
of O
these O
activities B-ACT
varied O
noticeably O
. O

In O
June B-TIME
we O
published O
on O
a O
previously O

named O
" O

" O
, O

, O
APT5 B-APT

based O

Southeast B-LOC

However O
, O
in O
the O
same O
week O
of O
September O
a O
series O
of O
spearphishing B-ACT
attempts O
once O
again O
targeted O
a O
set O
of O
otherwise O
unrelated O
individuals O
, O
employing O
the O
same O
tactics O
as O
before O
. O

Our O
primary O
contribution O
in O
this O
update O
is O
to O
implicate O
Bahamut O
in O
what O
are O
likely O
counterterrorism-motivated O
surveillance O
operations O
, O
and O
to O
further O
affirm O
our O
belief O
that O
the O
group O
is O
a O
hacker-for-hire O
operation O
. O

As O
we O
wrote O
then O
, O
compared O
to O
Kingphish O
, O
Bahamut O
operates O
as O
though O
it O
were O
a O
generation O
ahead O
in O
terms O
of O
professionalism O
and O
ambition O
. O

In O
the O
Bahamut O
report O
, O
we O
discussed O
two O
domains B-MAL
found O
within O
our O
search O
that O
were O
linked O
with O
a O
custom B-MAL
Android I-MAL
malware I-MAL
agent I-MAL
. I-MAL

After O
the O
publication O
of O
the O
original O
report O
, O
these O
sites O
were O
taken O
offline O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
one O
agent O
was O
even O
updated O
a O
six O
days O
prior O
to O
our O
post O
( O

for O
its O

the O

organization O
, O
which O
has O
committed O

in O

of O

Pakistani O
control O
over O
the O
disputed O

. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
it O
is O
already O
flagged O
as O
Bahamut O
by O
antivirus O
engines O
. O

Our O
initial O
observation O
of O
the O
Bahamut O
group O
originated O
from O
in-the-wild O
attempts O
to O
deceive O
targets O
into O
providing O
account O
passwords O
through O
impersonation O
of O
platform B-IDTY
providers I-IDTY
. I-IDTY

One O
curious O
trait O
of O
Bahamut O
is O
that O
it O
develops O
fully-functional O
applications O
in O
support O
of O
its O
espionage O
activities O
, O
rather O
than O
push O
nonfunctional O
fake O
apps O
or O
bundle O
malware O
with O
legitimate B-MAL
software I-MAL
. I-MAL

Curiously O
, O
Bahamut O
appears O
to O
track O
password O
attempts O
in O
response O
to O
failed O
phishing B-ACT
attempts O
or O
to O
provoke O
the O
target O
to O
provide O
more O
passwords O
. O

Bahamut O
spearphishing B-ACT
attempts O
have O
also O
been O
accompanied O
with O
SMS O
messages O
purporting O
to O
be O
from O
Google B-IDTY
about O
security O
issues O
on O
their O
account O
, O
including O
a O
class O
0 O
message O
or O
" O
flash B-TOOL
text O
" O
. O

These O
text O
messages O
did O
not O
include O
links O
but O
are O
intended O
to O
build O
credibility O
around O
the O
fake O
service O
notifications O
later O
sent O
to O
the O
target O
's O
email B-TOOL
address O
. O

We O
have O
not O
found O
evidence O
of O
Bahamut B-APT
engaging O
in O
crime O
or O
operating O
outside O
its O
limited O
geographic O
domains O
, O
although O
this O
narrow O
perspective O
could O
be O
accounted O
for O
by O
its O
compartmentalization O
of O
operations O
. O

Thus O
far O
, O
Bahamut B-APT
's I-APT
campaigns B-ACT
have O
appeared O
to O
be O
primarily O
espionage O
or O
information O
operations O
– O
not O
destructive B-ACT
attacks I-ACT
or O
fraud O
. O

The O
targets O
and O
themes O
of O
Bahamut O

have O
consistently O
fallen O

two O

We O
speculate O
that O
other O
attacks O
delivering O
Bookworm B-MAL
were O
also O
targeting O
organizations O
in O
Thailand B-LOC
based O
on O
the O
contents O

that O
contain O
the O
words O
" O

. O

We O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
likely O
threat O

will O
continue O
development O
Bookworm B-MAL
, I-MAL
and O
will O
continue O
to O

Threat O
actors O
have O
delivered O
Bookworm B-MAL
as O
a O

in O

on O

Analysis O
of O
compromised O

seen O
communicating O
with O
Bookworm B-MAL
C2 I-MAL

also O
confirms O
our O
speculation O
on O
targeting O

a O
majority O
of O

existing O
within O

As O
mentioned O
in O
our O
previous O
blog O
on O
Bookworm B-MAL
, I-MAL
the O
Trojan B-MAL
sends O
a O
static O
date O
string O
to O
the O
C2 B-TOOL
server O
that O
we O
referred O
to O
as O
a O
campaign O
code O
. O

We O
believed O
that O
the O
actors O
would O
use O
this O
date B-MAL
code I-MAL
to O
track O
their O
attack B-ACT
campaigns I-ACT
; I-ACT
however O
, O
after O
continued O
analysis O
of O
the O

, O
we O
think O
these O
static O
dates O
could O
also O
be O
a O
build O
identifier O
for O
the O
Trojan B-MAL
. I-MAL

Threat O
actors O
may O
use O
the O
date B-FILE
string I-FILE
hardcoded I-FILE
into O
each O
Bookworm B-MAL
sample I-MAL
as O
a O
build O
identifier O
. O

A O
Trojan B-MAL
sending O
a O
build O
identifier O
to O
its O
C2 B-TOOL
server O
is O
quite O
common O
, O
as O
it O
notifies O
the O
threat O
actors O
of O
the O
specific O
version O
of O
the O
Trojan B-MAL
in O
which O
they O
are O
interacting O
. O

Due O
to O
these O
changes O
without O
a O
new O
date B-FILE
string I-FILE
, I-FILE
we O
believe O
the O
date B-FILE
codes I-FILE
are O
used O
for O
campaign O
tracking O
rather O
than O
a O
Bookworm B-MAL
build O
identifier O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Bookworm B-MAL
samples I-MAL
use O
the O
static O
date O
string O
as O
campaign O
codes O
, O
which O
we O
used O
to O
determine O
the O
approximate O
date O
of O
each O

that O
we O
did O
not O
have O
detailed O

Buhtrap B-APT

however O
their O
first O
attacks O
against O

were O
only O
detected O
in O
August B-TIME
2015 I-TIME

At O
the O
moment O
, O
the O
group O
is O
known O
to O
target O
Russian O

Ukrainian O

. I-IDTY

Buhtrap B-APT
is O
the O
first O
hacker O
group O
using O
a O
network B-ACT
worm I-ACT
to O
infect O
the O
overall O
bank B-IDTY
infrastructure O
that O
significantly O
increases O
the O
difficulty O
of O
removing O
all O

Malicious O

intentionally O
scan O

then O
the O

We O

this O
method O
from O
May B-TIME
2015 I-TIME
to O
August B-TIME
2015 I-TIME

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
attackers O
used O
the O
same O
compromised B-MAL
websites I-MAL
to O
spread O
Buhtrap B-MAL
as O
those O
that O
had O
been O
used O
for O
the O
Corkow B-MAL
Trojan I-MAL
. I-MAL

Moreover O
, O
they O
used O
the O
same O
exploit B-VULNAME
kit I-VULNAME
Niteris I-VULNAME
as O
that O
in O
the O
Corkow B-MAL
case O
. O

Purportedly O
during O
one O
of O
the O
first O
attacks O
hackers O
intercepted O
the O
mailing O
list O
of O
the O
Anti-drop O
" O

and O
created O
a O
specific O
phishing B-ACT
email I-ACT
for O
its O
members O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
still O
widely O
used O
, O
notably O
in O
Russia B-LOC
. I-LOC

As O
noted O
in O
our O
previous O
blog O
on O
Buhtrap O
, O
this O
gang O
has O
been O
actively O
targeting O
Russian O
businesses B-IDTY
, I-IDTY
mostly O
through O
spear-phishing B-ACT
. I-ACT

It O
is O
thus O
interesting O
to O
see O
Buhtrap O
add O
strategic B-ACT
web I-ACT
compromises I-ACT
to O
their O
arsenal O
. O

The O
first O
malware O
we O
saw O
was O
the O
lurk B-MAL
downloader I-MAL
, I-MAL
which O
was O
distributed O
on O
October B-TIME
26th I-TIME
. I-TIME

The O
executable O
would O
install O
the O
real O
Ammyy O
product O
, O
but O
would O
also O
launch O
a O
file O
called O
either O
AmmyyService.exe B-FILE
or O
AmmyySvc.exe B-FILE
which O
contained O
the O
malicious O
payload O
. O

Buhtrap B-APT
is O
getting O
better O
at O
disguising O
the O
code O
they O
inject O
into O
compromised B-MAL
websites I-MAL
. I-MAL

With O
the O
recent O
arrests O
of O
actors O
using O
the O
Lurk B-MAL
banking I-MAL
trojan I-MAL
, I-MAL
Buhtrap O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
likely O
alternative O
for O
actors O
wishing O
to O
target O
Russian B-LOC
banks B-IDTY
and O
software O
. O

They O
have O
different O
functions O
and O
ways O
of O
spreading O
, O
but O
the O
same O
purpose O
— O
to O
steal O
money O
from O
the O
accounts O
of O
businesses B-IDTY
. I-IDTY

Our O
experts O
have O
found O
that O
cybercriminals O
are O
actively O
focusing O
on O
SMBs B-MAL
, I-MAL
and O
giving O
particular O
attention O
to O
accountants B-IDTY
. I-IDTY

The O
first O
encounter O
with O
Buhtrap O
was O
registered O
back O
in O
2014 B-TIME
. I-TIME

For O
now O
, O
we O
can O
call O
RTM B-MAL
one O
of O
the O
most O
active O
financial B-IDTY
Trojans O
. O

At O
that O
time O
it O
was O
the O
name O
of O
a O
cybercriminal O
group O
that O
was O
stealing O
money O
from O
Russian B-LOC
financial B-IDTY
establishments I-IDTY
— O
to O
the O
tune O
of O
at O
least O
$150,000 O
per O
hit O
. O

Buhtrap O
resurfaced O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
2017 B-TIME
in O
the O
TwoBee B-ACT
campaign I-ACT
, I-ACT
where O
it O
served O
primarily O
as O
means O
of O
malware O
delivery O
. O

After O
the O
source O
codes O
of O
their O
tools O
became O
public O
in O
2016 B-TIME
, I-TIME
the O
name O
Buhtrap O
was O
used O
for O
the O
financial B-MAL
Trojan I-MAL
. I-MAL

Just O
like O
last O
time O
, O
Buhtrap O
is O
spreading O
through O
exploits O
embedded O
in O
news B-IDTY
outlets I-IDTY
. I-IDTY

Estimating O
the O
damages O
is O
challenging O
, O
but O
as O
we O
learned O
, O
the O
criminals O
are O
siphoning O
off O
assets O
in O
transactions O
that O
do O
not O
exceed O
$15,000 O
each O

As O
explained O
later O
, O
we O
believe O
this O
campaign O
is O
financially-motivated O
and O
that O
it O
targets O
accounting B-IDTY
departments I-IDTY
in O
Russian O
businesses B-IDTY

inevitably O
the O

we O

both O
the O
Trochilus B-MAL

a O
newly O

named O
MoonWind B-MAL
to O
target O
organizations O
in O

, O
including O
a O
utility B-IDTY
organization I-IDTY

We O
chose O
the O
name O
' O
MoonWind B-MAL
' I-MAL
based O
on O
debugging O
strings O
we O
saw O
within O
the O
samples O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
compiler O
used O
to O
generate O
the O
samples O
. O

The O
attackers O
compromised O
two O
legitimate B-MAL
Thai I-MAL
websites I-MAL
to O
host O
the O
malware O
, O
which O
is O
a O
tactic O
this O
group O
has O
used O
in O
the O
past O
. O

Both O
the O
Trochilus B-MAL
and O
MoonWind B-MAL
RATs I-MAL
were O
hosted O
on O
the O
same O
compromised O
sites O
and O
used O
to O
target O
the O
same O
organization O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

The O
attackers O
used O
different O
command B-MAL
and I-MAL
control I-MAL
servers I-MAL
( O
C2s O
) O
for O
each O
malware O
family O
, O
a O
tactic O
we O
believe O
was O
meant O
to O
thwart O
attempts O
to O
tie O
the O
attacks O
together O
using O
infrastructure O
alone O
. O

Further O
research O
led O
us O
to O
additional O
MoonWind B-MAL
samples I-MAL
using O
the O
same O
C2 B-TOOL
( O
dns.webswindows.com O
) O
but O
hosted O
on O
a O
different O

but O
legitimate B-MAL

The O
attacks O
in O
that O
case O
took O
place O
in O
late O
September B-TIME
to O
early O
October B-TIME
2016 I-TIME

the O
attackers O
stored O
the O

while O
in O
the O
November B-ACT

We O
were O
not O
able O
to O
find O
additional O

but O
the O
attackers O
again O
compromised O
a O
legitimate O

in O
this O
case O
the O
student O

It O
is O
highly O

that O
the O

The O
main O
point O
that O
sets O

that O
it O

geopolitically O

The O
objective O
of O

One O
of O
the O
most O
notable O
functions O
of O
the O
initial O

is O
to O

uses O
the O
public O

exploit B-VULNAME
code O
CVE-2018-8120 B-VULID

The O
threat O
actors O
behind O
the O
Sea B-ACT
Turtle I-ACT
campaign I-ACT
show O
clear O
signs O
of O
being O
highly O
capable O
and O
brazen O
in O
their O
endeavors O
. O

In O
most O
cases O
, O
threat O
actors B-APT
typically O
stop O
or O
slow O
down O
their O
activities B-ACT
once O
their O
campaigns B-ACT
are O
publicly O
revealed O
. O

The O
threat O
actors O
behind O
the O
Sea B-ACT
Turtle I-ACT
campaign I-ACT
were O
successful O
in O
compromising O
entities O
by O
manipulating O
and O
falsifying O
DNS B-PROT
records O
at O
various O
levels O
in O
the O

If O
an O
attacker O
was O
able O
to O
compromise O
an O
organization's O
network O
administrator O
credentials O
, O
the O
attacker O
would O
be O
able O
to O
change O
that O
particular O
organization's O
DNS B-PROT
records O
at O
will O

If O
the O
attackers O
were O
able O
to O
obtain O
one O
of O
these O
EPP O
keys O

they O
would O
be O
able O
to O
modify O

The O
diagram O

illustrates O
how O
we O
believe O
the O
actors O
behind O
the O
Sea B-FILE
Turtle I-FILE
campaign O
used O
DNS B-PROT
hijacking O
to O
achieve O
their O
end O
goals O

As O
of O
early B-TIME
2019 I-TIME
, I-TIME
the O
only O
evidence O
of O
the O
spear-phishing B-ACT

provides O
support O
to O
Internet O
exchange O
points O
and O
the O
core O
of O
the O
domain O

, O
provided O
confirmation O
of O
this O
aspect O
of O
the O
actors’ B-APT
tactics O
when O
it O
publicly O
revealed O
its O
internal O
DNS B-PROT
had O
been O
briefly O
hijacked O
as O
a O
consequence O
of O
the O
compromise O
at O
its O
domain O
registrar O
. O

During O
a O
typical O
incident O
, O
the O
actor O
would O
modify O
the O
NS O
records O
for O
the O
targeted O
organization O
, O
pointing O
users O
to O
a O
malicious O
DNS B-PROT
server O
that O
provided O
actor-controlled O
responses O
to O
all O
DNS B-PROT
queries O
. O

The O
next O
step O
for O
the O
actor O
was O
to O
build O
MitM B-MAL
servers I-MAL
that O
impersonated O
legitimate O
services O
to O
capture O
user O
credentials O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
MitM B-TOOL
server O
IP O
addresses O
published O
in O
previous O
reports O
, O
Talos B-SECTEAM
identified O
16 O
additional O
servers O
leveraged O
by O
the O
actor O
during O
the O
observed O
attacks O
. O

The O
attackers O
would O
then O
use O
the O
certificate O
on O
actor-controlled O
servers O
to O
perform O
additional O
MitM B-MAL
operations O
to O
harvest O
additional O
credentials O
. O

In O
some O
cases O
, O
the O
victims O
were O
redirected O
to O
these O
actor-controlled O
servers O
displaying O
the O
stolen O
certificate O
. O

One O
notable O
aspect O
of O
the O
campaign O
was O
the O
actors' B-APT
ability O
to O
impersonate O
VPN B-TOOL
applications O
, O
such O
as O
Cisco B-IDTY
Adaptive B-TOOL
Security I-TOOL
Appliance I-TOOL
(ASA) O
products O
, O
to O
perform O
MitM B-ACT
attacks I-ACT
. I-ACT

At O
this O
time O
, O
we O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
the O
attackers B-APT
found O
a O
new O
ASA B-TOOL
exploit B-VULNAME
. I-VULNAME

Rather O
, O
they O
likely O
abused O
the O
trust O
relationship O
associated O
with O
the O
ASA's O
SSL O
certificate O
to O
harvest O
VPN B-TOOL
credentials O
to O
gain O
remote O
access O
to O
the O
victim's O
network O
. O

As O
an O
example O
, O
DNS B-PROT
records O
indicate O
that O
a O
targeted O

resolved O
to O
an O
actor-controlled O
MitM B-MAL
server I-MAL

In O
another O
case O
, O
the O
attackers B-APT
were O
able O
to O
compromise O
NetNod B-IDTY

a O
non-profit O

infrastructure I-IDTY
organization I-IDTY
based O
in O

Using O
this O
access O
, O
the O
threat O
actors O
were O
able O
to O
manipulate O
the O
DNS B-PROT
records O
for O
sa1[.]dnsnode[.]net B-DOM
. I-DOM

This O
redirection O
allowed O
the O

We O
assess O
with O
high O
confidence O
that O

in O
an O
attempt O
to O
re-establish O

We O

recently O
published O
a O
blogpost O
describing O
targeted B-ACT
attacks I-ACT
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
region O
which O
we O
believe O
may O
be O
connected O
. O

Operation O
Parliament O
appears O
to O
be O
another O
symptom O
of O
escalating O
tensions O
in O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
region O
. O

The O
attackers O
have O
taken O
great O
care O
to O
stay O
under O
the O
radar O
, O
imitating O
another O
attack O
group O
in O
the O
region O
. O

With O
deception O
and O
false O
flags O
increasingly O
being O
employed O
by O
threat O
actors B-APT
, I-APT
attribution O
is O
a O
hard O
and O
complicated O
task O
that O
requires O
solid O
evidence O
, O
especially O
in O
complex O
regions O
such O
as O
the O
Middle B-LOC
East I-LOC
. I-LOC

The O
malware B-FILE
was O
first O
seen O
packed O
with O
VMProtect; O
when O
unpacked O
the O
sample O
didn’t O
show O
any O
similarities O
with O
previously O
known O
malware O
. O

The O
malware B-FILE
starts O
communicating O
with O
the O
C&C B-TOOL
server O
by O
sending O
basic O
information O
about O
the O
infected O
machine O
. O

The O
malware B-FILE
basically O
provides O
a O
remote O
CMD/PowerShell B-MAL
terminal O
for O
the O
attackers B-APT
, I-APT
enabling O
them O
to O
execute O
scripts/commands O
and O
receive O
the O
results O
via O
HTTP B-PROT
requests O
. O

What O
lied O
beneath O
this O
facade O
was O
a O
well-engineered O
campaign O
of O
phishing O
attacks O
designed O
to O
steal O
credentials O
and O
spy O
on O
the O
activity O
of O
dozens O
of O
journalists O
, O
human O
rights O
defenders O
, O
trade O
unions O
and O
labour O
rights O
activists O
, O
many O
of O
whom O
are O
seemingly O
involved O
in O
the O
issue O
of O
migrants’ O
rights O
in O
Qatar O
and O
Nepal O
. O

We O
refer O
to O
this O
campaign O
and O
the O
associated O
actor O
as O
Operation B-ACT
Kingphish I-ACT
Malik” O
, O
in O
one O
of O
its O
written O
forms O
in O
Arabic O
, O
translates O
to O
King” O
. O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
in O
December B-TIME
2016 I-TIME
, I-TIME
Amnesty B-IDTY
International I-IDTY
published O
an O
investigation O
into O
another O
social O
engineering O
campaign O
perpetrated O
by O
a O
seemingly O
fake O
human O
rights O
organization O
known O
as O
Voiceless O
Victims O
, O
which O
targeted O
international O
human O
rights O
and O
labour O
rights O
organizations O
campaigning O
on O
migrant O
workers’ O
rights O
in O
Qatar O
. O

It O
appears O
that O
the O
attackers O
may O
have O
impersonated O
the O
identity O
of O
a O
real O
young O
woman O
and O
stole O
her O
pictures O
to O
construct O
the O
fake O
profile O
, O
along O
with O
a O
professional O
biography O
also O
stolen O
from O
yet O
another O
person O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
this O
email B-TOOL
correspondence O
, O
the O
attacker O
— O
Safeena” O
— O
then O
sent O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
invitations O
to O
access O
several O
documents O
on O
Google B-TOOL
Drive I-TOOL
. I-TOOL

The O
attackers O
were O
meticulous O
in O
making O
their O
phishing B-ACT
page O
as O
credible O
as O
possible O
. O

Among O
the O
targets O
of O
this O
campaign O
is O
the O
International B-IDTY
Trade I-IDTY
Union I-IDTY
Confederation I-IDTY
(ITUC) I-IDTY
. I-IDTY

Both O
in O
the O
attacks O
against O
ITUC B-IDTY

in O
other O
occasions O
, O

with O
them O
on O

off O

sometimes O
over O
a O
period O
of O
several O
months O
. O

This O
time O
the O
document O
purported O
to O
be O
about O
the O
involvement O
of O
the O
Emir B-LOC
of O
Qatar B-LOC
in O
funding O
ISIS B-LOC
, I-LOC
which O
was O
seemingly O
copied O
from O
a O

critical O
of O

While O
there O
is O
a O
clear O
underlying O
Qatar B-LOC
migrant O

theme O
in O
Operation B-APT
Sheep I-APT
, I-APT
it O
is O
also O
hypothetically O
possible O
that O
these O

could O
have O
been O
perpetrated O
by O
a O
malicious O

affiliated O
to O
a O
different O

Operation B-ACT
Pawn I-ACT

is O
an O
active O
economic B-IDTY

political B-IDTY
cyber-espionage O
operation O

We O
believe O
the O

gets O
installed O

Lastly O
, O
we O

we O

, O
this O

targets O
only O

We O
observe O
, O
with O
various O
level O

that O
there O
are O
several O

The O
last O
piece O
is O
the O

group O
, O
who O
targeted O

at O

2008 B-TIME

This O

the O

we O

At O
first O
glance O
CONFUCIUS_B B-FILE

very O

they O
are O

We O
also O
believe O
that O
both O

the O

we O

The O

Like O

much O
of O

We O
suspect O
that O

although O
the O

One O
curious O
trait O
of O
Bahamut O
is O
that O
it O
develops O
fully-functional O

activities O
, O
rather O
than O
push O

Curiously O
, O
Bahamut O
appears O
to O
track O

to O

the O

Thus O
far O
, O
Bahamut B-APT

Until O
this O
incident O
, O
no O
malware O
had O
been O
discovered O
misusing O
the O
AMT O
SOL O
feature O
for O
communication O

We O
confirmed O
that O
the O
tool O
did O
not O
expose O
vulnerabilities O
in O
the O
management O
technology O
itself O
, O
but O
rather O
misused O
AMT B-TOOL

within O

networks O
that O
have O
already O
been O

to O
keep O

stealthy O

In O
either O
case O
, O
PLATINUM B-APT
would O
need O
to O
have O
gained O

prior O
to O
the O

The O

One O
possibility O
is O
that O
PLATINUM B-APT
might O
have O
obtained O
compromised O
credentials O
from O
victim O

. O

Another O
possibility O
is O
that O
the O
targeted O

did O
not O
have O

provisioned O

PLATINUM B-APT
, I-APT
once O
they've O
obtained O

proceeded O
to O

During O
the O
provisioning O
process O
, O
PLATINUM B-APT
could O
select O
whichever O

they O
wish O
. O

The O

Microsoft B-IDTY
reiterates O

does O
not O
expose O

In O
2015 B-TIME

Dridex B-MAL

one O

on O
the O

, O
since O
2014 B-TIME

those O

are O
thought O
to O
have O
netted O
INDRIK B-APT

millions O
of O

in O
criminal O

. O

In O
August B-TIME
2017 I-TIME
, I-TIME
a O
new O
ransomware O
variant O
identified O
as O
BitPaymer B-APT
was O
reported O
to O

National O
Health B-IDTY

a O
high O
ransom O

of O
53 O

( O
approximately O
$200,000 O

) O
. O

The O
targeting O
of O
an O
organization O
rather O
than O
individuals O
, O
and O
the O
high O
ransom O
demands O
, O
made O
BitPaymer B-MAL
stand O
out O
from O
other O
contemporary O
ransomware O
at O
the O
time O
. O

Though O
the O
encryption O
and O
ransom O
functionality O
of O
BitPaymer B-MAL
was O
not O
technically O
sophisticated O
, O
the O
malware O
contained O
multiple O
anti-analysis O
features O
that O
overlapped O
with O
Dridex B-MAL
. I-MAL

Later O
technical O
analysis O
of O
BitPaymer B-MAL
indicated O
that O
it O
had O
been O
developed O
by O
INDRIK B-APT
SPIDER I-APT
, I-APT
suggesting O
the O
group O
had O
expanded O
its O
criminal O
operation O
to O
include O
ransomware B-MAL
as O
a O
monetization O
strategy O
. O

The O
beginning O
of O
2017 B-TIME
also O
brought O
a O
turning O
point O
in O
INDRIK O
SPIDER O
's O
operation O
of O
Dridex B-MAL
. I-MAL

CrowdStrike® B-SECTEAM

also O
observed O
a O
strong O
correlation O
between O

During O
incidents O
that O

to O
the O

of O
the O
BitPaymer B-MAL

Also O
unusual O
was O
the O
observation O
that O
both O
Dridex B-MAL

These O
new O

of O

have O
signaled O
a O

that O
INDRIK B-APT

not O
willing O

a O

We O

We O
suggest O
that O
APT41 B-APT
sought O
to O
target O
in-game O

but O
found O
they O
could O
not O
monetize O
