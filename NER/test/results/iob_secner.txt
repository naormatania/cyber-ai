The O

we O

the O

The O

That O
this O

apparent O
from O

(TTPs) O
of O
a O
Brazilian O
cyber O

group O
that O
specializes O
in O

card O

operations O
. O

The O
threat O
actors B-APT
, I-APT
observed O
by O
FireEye B-SECTEAM
Labs O
, O
use O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise O
or O
acquire O
already O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
, O
including O
sharing O
or O
purchasing O

online O
, O
hacking O
vulnerable O
merchant O
websites O
and O
compromising O
payment O

processing O
devices O
. O

Once O
in O

, O
the O
actors O
use O
these O
compromised O
payment O
card O
credentials O
to O
generate O
further O
card O
information O
. O

The O
members O
of O
the O
group O
use O
a O
variety O
of O
tools O
, O
including O
CCleaner B-MAL
, I-MAL
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
to O
effectively O
remove O
any O
evidence O

their O
operations O

Another O
common O
step O
taken O
by O
threat O
actors O
is O
changing O
their O
system's O
MAC O
Address O
to O
avoid O
being O
uniquely O
identified O
. O

For O
this O
purpose O
, O
these O
actors B-APT
often O
use O
tools O
such O
as O
Technitium B-TOOL
MAC B-TOOL
Address B-TOOL

observed O
these O

also O
observed O
them B-FILE
using O
virtual O

use O

ensure O

obfuscate O

this O

to O
either O

acquire O
already O

These O
actors B-APT
scan O

have O
discovered O
that O
this O
attack O
group O
, O
which O
we O
call O
Whitefly B-APT
, I-APT
has O
been O
operating O
since O
at O
least O
2017 B-TIME
, I-TIME
has O
targeted O
organizations O
based O
mostly O
in O
Singapore B-LOC
across O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
sectors O
, O
and O
is O
primarily O
interested O
in O
stealing O
large O
amounts O
of O
sensitive O
information O
. O

Whitefly B-APT
compromises O
its O

using O
custom O

and O
living B-ACT

From O
mid-2017 B-TIME
to O
mid-2018 B-TIME
, I-TIME
Whitefly B-APT
launched O
targeted B-ACT
attacks B-ACT
against O
multiple O
organizations O
. O

While O
most O
of O
these O
organizations O
were O
based O
in O
Singapore B-LOC
, I-LOC
some O
were O
multinational O
organizations O
with O
a O
presence O
in O
Singapore B-LOC
. I-LOC

To O
date O
, O
Whitefly B-APT
has O
attacked O
organizations O
in O
the O
healthcare B-IDTY
, I-IDTY
media B-IDTY
, I-IDTY
telecommunications B-IDTY
, I-IDTY
and O
engineering B-IDTY
sectors B-IDTY
. I-IDTY

Whitefly B-APT
first O
infects O
its O
victims O
using O
a O
dropper B-MAL
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
malicious.exe B-FILE
or O
.dll B-FILE
file B-FILE
that O
is O
disguised O
as O
a O
document O
or O
image O
. O

If O
opened O
, O
the O
dropper O
runs O
a O
loader O
known O
as O
Trojan.Vcrodat B-FILE
on O
the O
computer O
. O

Whitefly B-APT
has O
consistently O
used O
a O
technique O
known O
as O
search B-ACT
order B-ACT
hijacking B-ACT
to O
run O
Vcrodat B-MAL
. I-MAL

Once O
executed O
, O
Vcrodat B-MAL
loads O
an O
encrypted O
payload O
on O
to O
the O
victim O
's O
computer O
. O

Whitefly B-APT
rely O
heavily O
on O
tools O
such O
as O
Mimikatz B-MAL
to O
obtain O
credentials O
. O

Using O
these O
credentials O
, O
the O
attackers O
are O
able O
to O
compromise O
more O
machines O
on O
the O
network O
and O
, O
from O
those O
machines O
, O
again O
obtain O
more O
credentials O
. O

Whitefly B-APT
usually O
attempts O
to O
remain O
within O
a O
targeted O
organization O
for O
long O
periods O
of O
time—often O
months—in O
order O
to O
steal O
large O
volumes O
of O
information O
. O

In O
order O
to O
carry O
out O
this O
operation O
, O
it O
uses O
publicly B-MAL
available B-MAL
tools B-MAL
, I-MAL
including O
Mimikatz B-MAL
( O
Hacktool.Mimikatz O
) O
and O
an O
open-source O
tool O
that O
exploits O
a O
known O
Windows B-OS
privilege O

( O
CVE-2016-0051 O
) O
on O
unpatched O

. O

Like O
Vcrodat B-MAL
, I-MAL
Nibatad B-FILE
is O
also O
a O
loader O
that O
leverages O
search O
order O
hijacking O
, O
and O
downloads O
an O
encrypted O
payload O
to O
the O
infected O
computer O
. O

Why O
Whitefly B-APT
uses O
these O
two O
different O
loaders O
in O
some O
of O
its O
attacks O
remains O
unknown O
. O

While O
Vcrodat B-MAL
is O
delivered O
via O
the O
malicious O

, O
we O
have O
yet O
to O

how O
Nibatad B-MAL

We O
believe O
that O
the O

is O
a O
clear O
indicator O
of O
a O
new O

in O

in O

directly O
against O
the O

instead O
of O

. I-IDTY

Carbanak B-MAL
has O
its O
origin O
in O
more O
common O
financial O

including O

However O
, O
in O
September B-TIME
last O

, O
our O

published O
a O

detailing O
a O
new O
Carbanak B-MAL
variant O
affecting O
one O
of O
its O

. I-IDTY

Alternatively O
, O
it O
is O
also O
possible O
that O
APT41 B-APT
injected B-ACT
malicious B-ACT

into O
the O

, O
circumventing O
the O

In O
these O
instances O
, O
APT41 B-APT
leveraged O

to O
transfer O

, O
although O
we O
do O
not O
have O

In O
some O

, O

the O

The O
Dukes B-APT
are O
known O
to O
employ O
a O
vast O
arsenal O
of O
malware O
toolsets O
, O
which O
we O
identify O

and O
GeminiDuke B-MAL

The O
origins O
of O
the O
Duke O
toolset O
names O
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
when O
researchers O
at O
Kaspersky B-SECTEAM
Labs B-SECTEAM
coined O
the O
term O
" O
MiniDuke B-MAL
" O
to O
identify O
the O
first O
Duke-related B-MAL
malware B-MAL
they O
found O
. O

As O
researchers O
continued O
discovering O
new O
toolsets O
that O
were O
created O
and O
used O
by O
the O
same O
group O
that O
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke B-MAL
, I-MAL
and O
thus O
the O
threat O
actor O
operating O
the O
toolsets O
started O
to O
be O
commonly O
referred O
to O
as O
" O
Dukes B-APT
" O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
campaign O
identifiers O
found O
in O
PinchDuke B-MAL
samples B-MAL
discovered O
from O
2009 B-TIME
, I-TIME
the O
targets O
of O
the O
Dukes B-APT

such O
as O
the O

the O

Importantly O
, O
PinchDuke B-MAL
trojan B-MAL
samples B-MAL
always O
contain O
a O
notable O
text O
string O
, O
which O
we O
believe O
is O
used O
as O
a O
campaign O
identifier O
by O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group B-APT
to O
distinguish O
between O
multiple O
attack B-ACT
campaigns B-ACT
that O
are O
run O
in O
parallel O
. O

This O
neatly O
ties O
together O
many O
of O
the O
tools O
used O
by O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group B-APT
, I-APT
as O
versions O
of O
this O
one O
loader O
have O
been O
used O
to O
load O
malware O
from O
three O
different O
Dukes-related O
toolsets O
CosmicDuke B-MAL
, I-MAL
PinchDuke B-MAL
, I-MAL
and O
MiniDuke B-MAL
– O
over O
the O
course O
of O
five O
years O
. O

The O
Dukes B-APT
continued O
the O
expansion O
of O
their O
arsenal O
in O
2011 B-TIME
with O
the O
addition O
of O
two O
more O
toolsets O
: O
MiniDuke B-MAL
and O
CozyDuke B-MAL
. I-MAL

As O
we O
now O
know O
, O
by O
February B-TIME
2013 B-TIME
the O
Dukes B-APT
group B-APT
had O
been O
operating O
MiniDuke B-MAL
and O
other O
toolsets O
for O
at O
least O
4 O
and O
a O
half O
years O
. O

Secondly O
, O
the O
value O
the O
Dukes B-APT
intended O
to O
gain O
from O
these O
MiniDuke B-ACT
campaigns B-ACT
may O
have O
been O
so O
great O
that O
they O
deemed O
it O
worth O
the O
risk O
of O
getting O
noticed O
. O

This O
is O
in O
stark O
contrast O
to O
some O
other O
suspected O
Russian B-LOC
threat O
actors B-APT
( O
such O
as O
Operation B-ACT
Pawn B-ACT
Storm B-ACT
) I-ACT
who O
appear O
to O
have O
increased O
their O
targeting O
of O
Ukraine B-LOC
following O
the O
crisis O
. O

The O
Dukes B-APT
actively O
targeted O
Ukraine B-LOC
before O
the O
crisis O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
Russia B-LOC
was O
still O
weighing O
her O
options O
, O
but O
once O
Russia B-LOC
moved O
from O
diplomacy O
to O
direct O
action O
, O
Ukraine B-LOC
was O
no O
longer O
relevant O
to O
the O
Dukes B-APT
in O
the O
same O
way O
. O

In O
the O
latter O
case O
however O
, O
the O
Dukes B-APT
group B-APT
appear O
to O
have O
also O
simultaneously O
developed O
an O
entirely O
new O
loader O
, O
which O
we O
first O
observed O
being O
used O
in O
conjunction O
with O
CosmicDuke B-MAL
during O
the O
spring B-TIME
of B-TIME
2015 B-TIME
. I-TIME

The O
Dukes B-APT
could O
have O
ceased O
all O
use O
of O
CosmicDuke B-MAL
( O
at O
least O
until O
they O
had O
developed O
a O
new O

) O
or O
retired O
it O
entirely O
, O
since O
they O
still O
had O
other O
toolsets O
available O
. O

For O
these O
CozyDuke B-ACT
campaigns B-ACT
however O
, O
the O
Dukes B-APT
appear O
to O
have O
employed O
two O
particular O
later-stage O
toolsets O
, O
SeaDuke B-MAL
and O
HammerDuke B-MAL
. I-MAL

Firstly O
, O
as O
with O

campaigns B-ACT
in O
the O
summer B-TIME

, I-TIME
again O
the O
group O
clearly O
prioritized O
the O
continuation O
of O
their O
operations O
over O
maintaining O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
notably O
overt O
and O
large-scale O
campaigns B-ACT
with O
CozyDuke B-ACT
and O
CloudDuke B-ACT
, I-ACT
the O
Dukes B-APT
also O
continued O
to O
engage O
in O
more O
covert O
, O
surgical O
campaigns B-ACT
using O
CosmicDuke B-MAL
. I-MAL

We O
are O
however O
only O
aware O
of O
one O
instance O
- O
the O
exploitation O
of O
CVE-2013-0640 B-VULID
to O
deploy O
MiniDuke B-MAL
- O
where O
we O
believe O
the O
exploited O

was O
a O
zero-day B-VULNAME
at O
the O
time O
that O
the O

acquired O
the O

All O
of O
the O
available O
evidence O
however O
does O
in O

opinion O
suggest O
that O

operates O
on O

Because O

the O

Based O
on O
observed O
activity O
, O
we O
judge O
that O
APT38 B-APT

primary O
mission O
is O
targeting O
financial B-IDTY
institutions B-IDTY
and O
manipulating O
inter-bank O
financial O

financial B-IDTY
entities B-IDTY
since O
at O
least O
2014 B-TIME

We O
surmise O
that O
the O
targeting O
of O
banks B-IDTY

and O
government B-IDTY
agencies B-IDTY
is O

of O
efforts O

institutions B-IDTY
. I-IDTY

APT38 B-APT
also O
targeted O
financial B-IDTY
transaction B-IDTY

companies B-IDTY
likely O
because O
of O
their O
proximity O

we O
suggest O
two O

APT38 B-APT

in O

, O
is O
strongly O
distinguishable O
because O
of O
its O
specific O
focus O
on O

operations O
that O
attempt O
to O
use O

We O

confirm O
that O
the O
APT38 B-ACT
operator B-ACT
activity B-ACT
is O
linked O
to O
the O
North B-LOC

discovered O
Metel B-APT
in O
more O

It O
is O
highly O
likely O
that O
this O

more O
widespread O
and O
we O
urge O

to O
scan O
their O

for O
signs O
of O
the O
Metel B-MAL

. I-MAL

A O
second O
group O
, O
which O
we O
call O
GCMAN B-APT
because O
the O
malware O
is O
based O
on O
code O
compiled O
on O
the O
GCC O
compiler O
, O
emerged O
recently O
using O
similar O
techniques O
to O
the O
Metel B-APT
Group B-APT
to O
infect O
banking B-IDTY
institutions B-IDTY
and O
attempt O
to O
transfer O

Our O
investigations O
revealed O
that O
the O
attackers B-APT
drove O
around O
several O

stealing O
money O
from O

Once O

Our O
investigation O
revealed O
an O
attack O
where O
the O
GCMAN B-APT
group B-APT
then O
planted O
a O
cron B-ACT
script B-ACT
into O
bank B-IDTY
's I-IDTY
server O
, O
sending O
financial O
transactions O
at O
the O

of O
$200 O

The O
GCMAN B-APT
group B-APT
used O
an O
MS B-ACT

in O
commercial O
software O
running O
on O
one O

about O
a O

a O
half O
later O
, O
they O
came O
back O

During O
that O
time O
they O
poked O
70 O

three O

it O
was O
not O
obvious O
whether O

the O
one O
responsible O
for O
the O
fraudulent O

or O
if O
Lazarus B-APT
had O
in O
fact O
developed O
its O
own O

to O

systems O

We O
would O
like O
to O
add O
some O
strong O
facts O
that O
link O
some O
attacks O
on O
banks B-IDTY
to O
Lazarus B-APT
, I-APT
and O
share O
some O
of O
our O
own O
findings O
as O
well O
as O
shed O
some O
light O
on O
the O
recent O
TTPs O
used O
by O
the O

some O

Lazarus B-ACT
attacks B-ACT
are O
not O
a O
local O
problem O
and O
clearly O
the O
group O
's O
operations O
span O
across O
the O
whole O
world O
. O

Lazarus B-APT
was O
previously O
known O
to O
conduct O
cyberespionage B-ACT
and B-ACT
cybersabotage B-ACT
activities B-ACT
, I-ACT
such O
as O
attacks O
on O
Sony B-IDTY
Pictures B-IDTY
Entertainment B-IDTY
with O
volumes O
of O
internal O
data O
leaked O
, O
and O
many O
system O
harddrives O
in O
the O
company O
wiped O
. O

We O
believe O
that O
Lazarus B-APT
Group B-APT
is O
very O
large O
and O
works O
mainly O
on O
infiltration O
and O
espionage B-ACT
operations B-ACT
, I-ACT
while O
a O
substantially O
smaller O
units O
within O
the O
group O
, O
which O
we O
have O
dubbed O
Bluenoroff B-APT
, I-APT
is O
responsible O
for O
financial O
profit O
. O

Lazarus B-APT
regrouped O
and O
rushed O
into O
new O
countries O
, O
selecting O
mostly O
poorer O
and O
less O
developed O
locations O
, O
hitting O
smaller O
banks B-IDTY
because O
they O
are O
, O
apparently O
, O
easy O
prey O
. O

To O
date O
, O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
group B-APT
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
most O
successful O
in O
launching O
large O
scale O
operations O
against O
the O
financial B-IDTY
industry B-IDTY
. I-IDTY

We O
believe O
that O
Lazarus B-APT
will O
remain O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
threats O
to O
the O
banking B-IDTY
sector B-IDTY
, I-IDTY
finance B-IDTY
, I-IDTY
and O
trading B-IDTY
companies B-IDTY
, I-IDTY
as O
well O
as O

for O
the O
next O
few O
years O
. O

We O
believe O
Lazarus B-APT
started O
this O
watering B-ACT
hole B-ACT

at O
the O
end B-TIME
of B-TIME

A O
rudimentary O
but O
somewhat O
clever O
design O
, O
KiloAlfa B-MAL
provides O
keylogging O
capability O
for O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group B-APT
's I-APT
collection O
of O
malicious O
tools O
. O

The O
design O
of O
KiloAlfa B-MAL
is O
broken O
down O
into O
two O
basic O
components O
: O
the O
persistence O
functionality O
and O
the O
keylogging B-MAL
functionality B-MAL
. I-MAL

The O
persistence O
functionality O
of O
KiloAlfa B-MAL
allows O
the O
malware O
to O
self-install O
on O
a O
victim O
's O
machine O
when O
activated O
( O
described O
below O
) O
. O

Evidence O
suggest O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group B-APT
uses O
compromised B-MAL
infrastructure B-MAL
as O
the O
public-facing O
touchpoint O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
their O
malware O
samples O
. O

PapaAlfa B-MAL
is O
believed O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
proxy O
malware O
components O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group B-APT
uses O
to O
hide O
the O
true O
command O
and O
control O
server O
( O
s O
) O
for O
operations O
. O

Rather O
, O
PapaAlfa B-MAL
could O
be O
considered O
a O
smart O
proxy O
due O
in O
part O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
can O
easily O
switch O
the O
backend O
destination O
address O
and O
port O
without O
having O
to O
reestablish O
control O
over O
the O
infected O
machine O
hosting O
the O
PapaAlfa B-MAL
malware B-MAL
. I-MAL

In O
terms O
of O
form O
factor O
, O
PapaAlfa B-MAL
comes O
in O
two O
flavors O
: O
service B-MAL
DLL B-MAL
and O
standalone B-MAL
executable B-MAL
. I-MAL

The O
IndiaBravo-PapaAlfa B-MAL

While O
the O

integral O
to O
the O
Lazarus B-APT
Group B-APT

cyber O
operations O
, O
both O

destructive O
in O
nature O
, O
making O
them O
inherently O
dangerous O
to O

These O
tools O
often O
lay O
the O
groundwork O
for O
further O
malicious B-ACT
activity B-ACT

as O
the O

of O

the O
